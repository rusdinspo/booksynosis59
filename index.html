By their words and examples, they have inspired countless individuals to live better and more meaningful lives and have shaped the institutions and worldviews we live in today. Four Wise Men is an accessible introduction to each of these sages in his historical context and a provocative comparison of their lives and teachings. Through careful study, this book examines the ways these fascinating figures speak as one and the ways they differ. Although their voices come from the distant past, they still have wise words to say to us today.</p><p>Mark W. Muesse is the W. J. Millard Professor of Religious Studies at Rhodes College. He is the author of The Hindu Traditions (2011) and The Age of the Sages (2013).&#34;Four Wise Men offers a compelling and provocative comparative study of extraordinarily gifted leaders whose lives and teachings not only shaped great world religions, they provided invaluable, timeless guides for how to live well even in the face of great adversity.

Westree: Teen Cat Burglar</p><p>When K. Westree arrives at Bellsong Academy, she thinks she's left her cat-burgling past behind her. But K. soon discovers the school has a mystery of its own, a hidden treasure left behind by its founder, and she's the only one who has a hope of finding it. As she resumes her cat-burgling in an attempt to discover the school's secrets, K. begins to question if a normal life is really what she wants.</p></p><p><p>Richard Sala grew up with a fascination for musty old museums, dusty old libraries, cluttered antique shops, narrow alleyways, hidden truths, double meanings, and late night walks. He is known for an expressionistic style combining elements of horror, mystery, and whimsy. Often compared to figures like Edward Gorey or Gris Grimley, he has collaborated with such luminaries as Art Spiegelman and Lemony Snickett, and has illustrated a rediscovered script written by Jack Kerouac. His illustrations and comics have appeared in <i>RAW</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Sala's style is cheerfully over-the-top, and the well-constructed plot, which is big on girl-power, as well as the sharply drawn characters will pull the reader in.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] high-quality caper comic.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;The contrast between the hulking and misshapen adult nogoodniks in the cast and the four slim, leggy teens adds retro charm to a tale well stocked with menacing characters, mysterious voices, rococo hazards and atmospheric shadows.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;From its cinematic opening &#x2013; a cliffhanger cutaway of a girl being chased by a wild boar &#x2013; this noir comic sets up an inviting oddball mystery. K. Westree arrives at the remote Bellsong Academy for Girls to discover that the school isn't in session. Instead, a cruel headmistress is training the other three "students" to be thieves as part of some grand scheme, and K. has been tapped to join them. Sala's style is cheerfully over-the-top, and the well-constructed plot, which is big on girl-power, as well as the sharply drawn characters will pull the reader in. &#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sala, with his gothic expressionism charms intact, offers his first graphic novel for a YA audience. Katherine (who goes by K.) was raised in an orphanage by a mistress who indoctrinated the children in the arts of thievery. Now, she finds herself at a musty old boarding school run by a secret organization called "The Obtainers," dedicated to the finer points of cat burglary. Along with four other students, K. embarks on a high-wire series of art heists, but when the other girls start disappearing and a bit of light gets shed on the organization's darker secrets, she begins to reconsider her role. Sure, readers might hope for more substantial characterization or smoother plot development, but the spooky, tiptoeing atmosphere of Sala's art and the sneakily sinister undertones of the story are the real draws. This high-quality caper comic should appeal to readers dismayed by the shuttering of DC's teen girl&#x2013;centric Minx imprint, but it will by no means be limited to them. Several unresolved elements hint at possible sequels.&#x201d; &#x2015;Ian Chipman, <i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sala usually aims his pulpy gothics at older teens and adults, but here he tries for a younger audience. The art is far more finished than the sketchy plot. Trained since childhood by Fagin-esque Mother Claude to be a thief, teenage K. is dispatched to a supposed girls' school in a creepy mansion surrounded by dark woods and, along with a trio of fellow "students," breaks into three nearby houses to steal paintings that contain clues to a pirate treasure buried nearby. Filling in the back story requires so much explanation that swollen dialogue balloons nearly fill some of the cartoon panels, but the contrast between the hulking and misshapen adult nogoodniks in the cast and the four slim, leggy teens adds retro charm to a tale well stocked with menacing characters, mysterious voices, rococo hazards and atmospheric shadows. Expect sequels. (Graphic fiction. 10-12)&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sala's charming new graphic novel recalls a revamp of the Nancy Drew mysteries-produced under the hypnotic gaze of Edward Gorey. Silver-haired orphan K. is a prodigious young thief who struggles with the legacy and implications of her larcenous talent. Her enrollment in a peculiar young women's academy promises respite from her troubled upbringing, but soon reveals a direct link to her own mysterious past as her skills are pressed into service for an unknown goal. Sala meets the publisher's smaller, digest-sized format with an economical visual style, fleshed out with gemlike watercolors, brilliantly reproduced.</p><p>&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Gr 5-9-K. arrives at a peculiar, isolated private school after having been raised as a pickpocket in an orphanage following the disappearance of her circus-acrobat-cum-cat-burglar father. It turns out that the only other three girls at the school are also thieves, and the instructors are part of a guild of criminals and were allies of K.'s dad-or so they hastily claim when pressed. The school is owned by her aunt, who is very ill, and the guild-"The Obtainers"-hope that the teen will help them discover lost treasure on the grounds that could pay for medical treatments and the restoration of the school. Nothing is what it seems, particularly the disappearances of K.'s classmates during heists to procure clues about the treasure. The artwork is a winning mixture of lovely and comically ugly. This dichotomy, shown in the visuals, is further evidenced in the dialogue, where the guild members are transparent and broad in their motivations and delivery, while the girls are given casual dialogue and a number of funny moments. The story is structured like a lighthearted cross between a fable and a horror film, but only ever teetering on the edge of horror without depicting it. This could have resulted in a mishmash, but Sala elegantly dances through the creepy and the sweet.&#x201d; &#x2015;Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, NH, <i>School Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Fifteen-year-old K arrives at Bellsong Academy expecting to be welcomed by her long-lost aunt. Instead she is greeted by member of The Obtainers, a secret organization of thieves. They have been watching K grow up, first in an orphanage where the headmistress trained the children to be pickpockets, and then in reform school, where K ended up after the orphanage was disbanded by the authorities. Now that they have K and three other girls in their clutches, The Obtainers are expecting K to use her skills to find the clues that will lead them to a treasure hidden beneath Bellong Academy. But when the other girls begin disappearing and The Obtainers story stops adding up, K takes steps to solve the mystery herself. </p><p>Cat Burglar Black has a style most often found in European comics. The pen and watercolor pictures are graceful and the occasional wordless pages are beautifully composed to convey K's tension or emotion. </p><p>The story reads like a Tintin/Oliver Twist hybrid and is mostly successful. That the girls do not instantly bond in friendship is refreshing and K's loner status and sense of isolation is believable. While the plot becomes convoluted at times, the bones of the story are solid and the characters, particularly the villains, are fun takes on the standard tropes. Some major threads are left dangling, so a sequel is sure to come. </p><p>Upper elementary and middle school readers will look forward to reading more about K and her adventures.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>ICv2</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this boisterous graphic novel crime caper, K., a white-haired teen raised to be a cat burglar, believes she's escaped that life forever when her aunt issues an invitation to join her at the secluded Bellsong Academy for Girls. But all is not as it seems. K.'s past--as one of many orphans corralled into thievery by the villainous Mother Claude--is closer to her present than she suspects. The other girls (all three of them) are secretive, if friendly, and possess unlikely skill sets that match her own, and her aunt is locked away with a mysterious illness. And the school? Turns out it's run by a criminal society known as The Obtainers, of which Mother Claude and, apparently, K.'s father were members. Soon K. is employing her high-wire larceny talents once more, pursuing a project for the Obtainers, while her classmates disappear one by one. Sala's nightscapes are deep-hued and creepy, in stark contrast to the jewel-toned outdoor scenes, and the zany backstories, tongue-in-cheek hints, and quick-moving plot make for an entertaining tale. The transparent shiftiness of his villains injects a little levity amidst all the dire Gothic undertones, while the bizarre cast of characters balances K.'s soul-searching as she tries to reconcile her moral leanings with the "rush" of stealing. The ending is abrupt, and the fates of the other girls are left too open (and most likely dismal) for the sunny, pat conclusion to ring true. Here's hoping this means that sequels are on the way.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Horn Book</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this graphic novel, orphaned teen K. Westree has been brought up to a life of crime, but she has hope for better days ahead now that her aunt has summoned her to boarding school, Bellsong Academy for Girls. K. quickly realizes there's something amiss, though: only three other girls are in attendance, the faulty is a pretty creepy lot, and her aunt is bedridden and bandaged from head to toe. The other girls, all criminally trained like herself, take K. on a tour of the tenebrous premises, and the headmistress, the grossly misnamed Mrs. Turtledove, explains the mission for which they are being prepared: to break into three neighboring houses and steal family portraits that, together, will offer a clue to the whereabouts of a hidden treasure. The quartet, a sort of teenaged Charlie's Devils right down to their diverse hair colors, fulfills the mission, but at the price of losing one girl at each heist, leaving only K. to face the evil staff at the big climax, recover her real missing aunt, and hint at adventures yet to come. Girls who feel underserved by comic-book adventures will appreciate the strong female characters of the nasty, nice, and misguided ilk and the sleek black night-prowling garb and masks that keep the girls chic on their midnight encounters with man-eating fish, murderous statuary, and a notorious serial killer. Job One for K. now is to discover what happened to her missing schoolmates, so cue the theremin and stay tuned for episodes to come. &#x201d; &#x2015;<i>BCCB</i></p></p><h2>A Broken Vessel (Julian Kestrel Mystery)</h2><p>An anguished letter wrapped in a handkerchief puts dandyish detective Julian Kestrel and his valet&#39;s impish sister on a case of murder and rape that leads them through the highest and lowest places of 1820s London. 15,000 first printing. $10,000 ad/promo.</p><p>YA-Ross's second mystery about Julian Kestrel, the Regency dandy, teams him with Sally Stokes, a cockney prostitute who helps him solve a clever and devilish murder. One night, as is her custom, Sally steals a handkerchief from each of her three clients. In one, she finds a letter from a woman being held against her will and begging for help. A concerned and frightened Sally runs into her brother, a reformed pickpocket and Kestrel's valet. Soon she and Kestrel are matching wits to find the owner of the handkerchief and locate the desperate woman. Through dogged legwork they locate the three men, each from a different strata of society but each of whom has something serious to hide relating to a young heiress, the Reclamation Society, and the seamy underground life of London's Haymarket District. The clues come thick and fast in this action-packed mystery. Ross provides a good look at the beginnings of the London police force as well as the working of the English courts and the role of magistrates in this authentic view of early 19th-century social life.<br><i> Mary T. Gerrity, Queen Anne School Library, Upper Marlboro, MD</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this atmospheric and gritty mystery set in 1820's London, dandy Julian Kestrel (first encountered in Cut to the Quick ) searches out the truth about a supposed suicide. Sally Stokes, a "game girl," or prostitute--and the sister of Julian's valet--likes to lift handkerchiefs from her clients. Among the three she collects in one night's work, she finds a letter from an obviously upper-class young woman despairing over her fate in an establishment for fallen women. Intrigued by the mystery, Julian and Sally set out to determine her identity. Sally insinuates herself into the Reclamation Society, where she learns that one of the inmates is a recent suicide, while Julian attempts to trace the owners of the handkerchiefs. The closets of these gentlemen, however, harbor assorted skeletons, and Julian and Sally's investigations draw them ever deeper into danger. Ross briskly explores the sordid underbelly of the Regency period with sharply etched characters, authentic slang and a smartly intricate plot sweetened by a fetching and unusual love story. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Side of the Mountain Trilogy: My Side of the Mountain / On the Far Side of the Mountain / Frightful&#39;s Mountain</h2><p>3 titles.

Grade 1-5&#x2013;A comically dense couple named Horace and Glenda Pork-Fowler (a pig and a goose, of course) receives an invitation from Dr. Hunter, the new owner of Eatum Hall, "...for a weekend of free gourmet food!" Exclamation points abound in this pun-filled excursion to an English manor that's crammed with all sorts of ominous items, including knives, axes, oil paintings of animals being devoured by wolves, and a Walter Crane portrait of Red Riding Hood. High tech mixes with an old-fashioned mystery as the food-loving couple is instructed by the absent host to partake in "...a fully automated dining experience." Robotic devices serve the Pork-Fowlers delicious meals, but observant readers will catch glimpses of other machines designed for more predatory uses. In the end, the Pork-Fowlers are saved by their own oblivious gluttony, a fitting conclusion to this delightful story. The digitally created pictures have an impressionistic quality that lends a look of unpolished spontaneity. There's beautiful use of color and exaggeration of all sorts to add atmosphere. A wealth of visual and verbal details will engage children on many levels.

This book examines instances in which flying conditions were so adverse that accepted aviation wisdom, even after so many years and countless thousands of flying hours, was shown to be lacking. The fate of a DC-9 enroute to Atlanta in April 1977, a Boeing 727 taking off from New Orleans in July, 1982, and a Boeing 747 which flew into a cloud of volcanic dust over the Timor Sea in June of the same year, all further attest to the truth so clearly spelt out in Volume 1, that air safety standards are won at a price. </p><p>Nor has the complex relationship between technological progress and expertise on the one hand, and human frailty on the other, been fully resolved. In aviation, perhaps more so than in other fields of human endeavour, mankind remains as much a victim of himself as of the elements around him. It is ironic that while one facet of the world airline industry was operating supersonic aircraft designed to stretch one foot in length as a result of atmospheric frictional heating at Mach 2 airspeeds, another was "saving" time and effort by using a forklift to change the wing engines of a widebodied trijet - with fatal consequences to all on board a DC-10 at Chicago in May 1979. Other tragedies examined in this book, in which human failings negated state-of-the-art technology in either flying operations or engineering maintenance, tell of similar contradictions. </p><p>In this second volume, covering the years 1977 to 1991, specialist air safety author Macarthur Job and noted aviation artist Matthew Tesch continue their collaborative efforts, combining their skills and flying experiences to provide detailed, lucid analyses of the stories behind a further 15 significant jet airline disasters - and one amazing near tragedy. </p><p>Based primarily on official investigation reports, supplemented by extensive external research, each of these events has been carefully selected to exemplify the problems encountered, both operational and human, as jet airline flying moved into its second quarter century. Liberally complemented with photographs and diagrams, Air Disaster Volume 2 continues the unique style set in Volume 1, with many specially drawn diagrams and explanatory graphics. Clear and accurate, they blend actual piloting experience with artistic skill to enable readers to properly visualise the compelling events related in the text.</p></p><p>On the flightdeck <p>The smoke haze on the 747's flightdeck had become considerable, and accompanied by the smell of electrical arcing. </p><p>Watching his systems instrument panel closely, Flight Engineer Townley-Freeman had checked and re-checked for any indication of fire, but could find nothing. The smoke could be the result of an electrical or airconditioning problem without there actually being any fire, and the smell strongly suggested that it was electrical. </p><p>He was about to begin the Airconditioning Smoke Drill procedure when one of the pneumatic supply "valve closed" warning lamps began to flicker. A moment later No 4 engine surged and flamed out. In accordance with standard emergency procedures, the Flight Engineer immediately called: "Engine Failure Number Four!" </p><p>Captain Moody responded at once with the command: "Fire Action Number Four!" He then wound in rudder trim to compensate for the asymmetric thrust. </p><p>Together the first officer and flight engineer immediately carried out the memory items of the Engine Fire/Failure Drill emergency shutdown procedure, subsequently confirming their actions from the emergency checklist. They then quickly completed the One Generator Inoperative Drill to ensure that the aircraft's electrical system would not be overloaded </p><p>Only a minute later Townley-Freeman suddenly announced a second engine failure. "Number Two's gone!" he called. The failure of a second engine was serious indeed - but the Boeing 747 would still be capable of maintaining flight and diverting for an emergency landing. </p><p>But before the crew even had time to begin the emergency shutdown procedure for No 2 engine, the unbelievable occurred - almost simultaneously, the remaining Nos 1 and 3 engines surged and flamed out! </p><p>Incredulously, Townley-Freeman called: "I don't believe it - all four have failed!"</p></p><h2>A day for damnation (The war against the Chtorr)</h2><p>1984 1st Pbk.

Forster: A Life</h2><p>This authorized biography traces the growth of the novelist--his education and travels, his literary success, his sexual and social emancipation as an admitted homosexual, and his emergence as an active public figure</p><p>P. N. FURBANK is Professor Emeritus at the Open University.In 1933, with all his novels written but nearly 40 years of life ahead, E. M. Forster mused on his future biography: "I should want everything told, everything, and there's so far so little." P. N. Furbank, a friend of Forster in his eighties, has indeed told everything, sharply but sympathetically, and there is enormous sadness and strangeness in the "so little" that there is to tell. Coddled, fatherless child in an all - female Victorian household, Morgan grew up to be the "freakish and demure" ineffectual stereotype, but wrote a handful of surprisingly vigorous and influential novels that brought him fame - fame that increased with "every book he didn't write." Terribly timid and thoroughly homosexual, he lived an idle "life of mild human contacts and awakened imagination": some travel, some speechmaking and conference-sitting, less and less writing, many intense friendships, a few brief love affairs (an Egyptian bus conductor, a palace barber in India, a sailor), but a sex life lived mostly in fantasies, some of them written into unpublishable "indecencies" and the posthumous Maurice. Though Furbank remains admirably restrained and non-sensationalizing, Forster's preoccupation with his thwarted sexuality - in letters, diaries, and conversation - becomes the dark major chord. "However gross my desires, I find I shall never satisfy them for fear of annoying others. . . . If I could get one solid night it would be something." A literary lion, a social mouse; the contrast is both pathetic and funny, and Furbank quietly allows both sides to emerge - in Forster's hopeless weekends with impatient D. H. Lawrence ("Why can't he [Forster] take a woman and fight clean to his own basic, primal being?"), in his passive drift from the lost family manse to rooms at Cambridge or friends' homes ("I see my furniture everywhere, my home nowhere"), in his decades of buddyship - confessing his passion only near the end - with a married policeman. This is not a biography-with-criticism, and Furbank steers clear of the books except for obvious parallels with the life and descriptions of unpublished work. It therefore hasn't the impact of an Edel or Bate life-and-works. But it is hard to imagine a fairer, shrewder, more gracefully compassionate evocation of such a long, pinched, intensely inactive life.

A third-generation westerner, he lives in Seattle.Powerhouse story of an iconoclastic sheriff who cracked through 54 years of police coverups and solved the oldest open murder case in the country. Beginning with a brilliant evocation of 1935 Spokane and Pend Oreille County, Egan (Seattle bureau chief of The New York Times; The Good Rain, 1990) sets the scene for the killing of Spokane town marshal George Conniff, who had surprised men stealing butter from the local creamery. In the fifth year of the Depression, Spokane was full of reluctant hobos--many of them farmers who had fled the dust bowls of the Midwest--living, hungry for food and work, in a Hooverville by the local rail yards. The Spokane police regularly extorted sex, food, and money from these ``vagrants'' and collected also from the bootleggers, saloons, whorehouses, Chinese lotteries, and opium dens in the ``Queen City of the Richest Empire in the Western Hemisphere.'' When a shortage doubled the price of butter, 6'3'' rock-fisted Detective Clyde Ralstin and his partner profitably robbed dairies until the night that Conniff was killed. Ralstin was fingered for the killing by fellow detective Charles Sonnabend, but Sonnabend was ordered by the brass to stop investigating, and Ralstin disappeared. Fifty-four years later, in 1989, 47-year-old Sheriff Anthony Bamonte--former logger, Vietnam vet, Spokane cop--was writing his master's thesis on the ten previous sheriffs of Pend Oreille County and discovered a 1955 deathbed statement by Sonnabend about the coverup. Bamonte began to probe the case and, amazingly, men and women in their 80s and 90s who had known Ralstin came forward. Egan's narration of Bamonte's methodical stalking, of the ring of paranoia tightening around Ralstin (living in a tiny Montana town and knowing of the hunt), and of murder refusing to stay buried after 54 years--all make for compulsive, white-knuckle reading. Egan rises into the Most Wanted group of true-crime writers with this smoothly told, exciting account. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

ROBERT DARWIN, IN 1836,</p><p>AFTER CHARLES&#x2019;S FIVE-YEAR VOYAGE</p><p><br>In the summer of 1838, in his rented rooms on Great Marlborough Street, London, Charles Darwin drew a line down the middle of a piece of scrap paper. He had been back in England for almost two years, after a monumental voyage around the world. He was in his late twenties. It was time to decide. Across the top of the left-hand side, he wrote <em>Marry. </em>On the right he wrote <em>Not Marry. </em>And in the middle: <em>This is the Question. </em>It was easy for Charles to think of things to write under <em>Not Marry.</em></p><p>&#x201c;Freedom to go where one liked,&#x201c; he began. Charles loved to travel. His voyage had lasted almost five years; he had been the naturalist on the HMS <em>Beagle</em>, a British surveying ship. He was horribly seasick while on board, but he spent as much time as he could on land, exploring on horseback and onfoot, and collecting thousands of specimens, from corals in the Cocos-Keeling Islands of the Indian Ocean to beetles in Australia to a fox in Chilo� Island, Chile. He now lived in London with his servant from the <em>Beagle, </em>Syms Covington, &#x201c;Fiddler and Boy to the Poop Cabin.&#x201d; Charles had taught Syms to shoot and skin birds and to help him list and catalogue the specimens. Now Charles and Syms were surrounded by neatly stacked wooden crates, casks, and barrels filled with many of their treasures from Patagonia, Brazil, Chile, and Tierra del Fuego: fossil bones, skins, shells, fish preserved in spirits of wine, mammalia in spirits of wine, insects, reptiles and birds in spirits of wine, plants, rocks, carcasses of dead animals, and beetles. What if Charles wanted to go on another adventure and collect more specimens? How could he do that if he got married?</p><p>Next, under <em>Not Marry </em>he wrote: &#x201c;&#x2014;choice of Society &amp; little of it.&#x2014;Conversation of clever men at clubs&#x2014;&#x201d; On Great Marlborough Street, Charles lived just a few doors away from his older brother, Erasmus, and he was</p><p>spending much of his time with Eras and his circle of intellectual friends, which included the historian and writer Thomas Carlyle and his wife, Jane; the writer Harriet Martineau; and the Darwins&#x2019; first cousin, Hensleigh Wedgwood. They discussed the huge changes in England brought on by industrialization. When Charles had left for his voyage, there were a few trains; now the railroad zigzagged all over the country, reaching places only horse-drawn carriages had gone before. The growing number of mills and factories changed the landscape as well; towns and cities were expanding, as was the division between rich and poor. The rich benefited from the new industry and from Great Britain&#x2019;s burgeoning empire.</p><p>The poor suffered in the squalor that Charles Dickens was capturing so well in his serialized novels. Erasmus and his circle debated the Poor Laws, which were shunting the destitute into workhouses; they discussed the need for social</p><p>reform.</p><p>There were divisions in religion in nineteenth-century England, too. Religious zealots and religious dissenters were making noise while members of the Church of England and Unitarians like the Darwins also quietly questioned their</p><p>faith. Freethinking liberals, Eras and his circle were respected members of the British upper classes, and Charles found it easy&#x2014;and stimulating&#x2014;to be with them. Because they were open-minded and liberal, Charles knew he could broach with them some of the radical scientific thoughts he was beginning to have. This was what mattered to him. Not going to dinner parties, teas, and other torturous social occasions where people inundated him with seemingly endless questions about his travels.</p><p>Not that all of his social occasions were torturous. Charles was spending time with&#x2014;and being courted by&#x2014;three sisters in one family. The Horner girls were clever young women, well-read and educated, with promising intellectual</p><p>futures. They even shared his interest in natural history, geology, and zoology. Their oldest sister, Mary, was already married to a new friend of his, Charles Lyell, a prominent geologist. Mr. Horner approved of Charles Darwin as a son-inlaw and hoped for a match. &#x201c;I have not seen anyone for a long time with a greater store of accurate knowledge,&#x201c; he wrote to Mary. Erasmus teased Charles, calling Mrs. Horner &#x201c;Motherin-law.&#x201d; So the marriage question was not hypothetical. And Charles Darwin <em>was </em>a good catch. He was a tall man, about six feet, thickset&#x2014;big but not fat. He was athletic and fit from his adventures on the voyage. He dressed conservatively in the styles of the day: tailcoat, fine linen shirt with standing collar, and tall hat. He had gray eyes, a ruddy complexion, and a pleasant face, though he did not like his nose, which he felt was too big and bulbous. He was from an upstanding, wealthy</p><p>family; he had much to talk about, and he had a promising future. His reputation had, as they say, preceded him. While he was traveling, Charles had sent back thousands of his specimens to his old Cambridge professor, John Stevens Henslow. Some of these specimens had begun to make him famous in the natural history world before he had even returned to England, including a rare fossil head of a giant ground sloth he had found in Argentina &#x201c;in horizontal position in the cemented gravel; the upper jaw &amp; molars exposed,&#x201c; as Charles had written in his first geological specimen notebook. The remarkable fossil sloth head had been presented at a meeting of the British Association of the Advancement of Science in Cambridge.</p><p>But if he were to marry one of the Horner girls, or anyone else, he could see the obligations ahead, whereas if he remained single, he would be freer to pursue his science. He added to the <em>Not Marry </em>side of his list, &#x201c;Not forced to</p><p>visit relatives, &amp; to bend in every trifle.&#x201d; He liked his brother, his sisters, his cousins the Wedgwoods. But what if he didn&#x2019;t like his wife&#x2019;s relatives? There was so much compromising you had to do if you were married. He could see it in his friends, many of whom had gotten married while he was away.</p><p>Walking down the street one day not long after he had gotten back, he had seen his cousin Hensleigh carrying a child in one hand and a round box in the other. Hensleigh had married a cousin from the other side of his family in 1832, the year Charles left on the voyage. (First cousins often married at this time, especially in the upper classes.) Now Hensleigh had two children, and Charles shuddered at the thought of all the juggling a young father had to do. Did he want the responsibility? His reaction to this scene was so strong that it made the rounds of the family gossip: Emma Wedgwood, Hensleigh&#x2019;s sister, wrote to her sister-in-law with amusement how struck Charles was by Hensleigh&#x2019;s juggling. Not surprising, therefore, that Charles continued his <em>Not Marry </em>list with &#x201c;&#x2014;to have the expense &amp; anxiety of children&#x2014; perhaps quarrelling.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t just the time and distraction that worried him; although he was frugal, he doubted he would ever make enough money by collecting beetles and writing about coral. Lack of money always led to fights, that he knew. And could he stand the anxiety and worry of having children? Cholera, a deadly disease, had just reached England for the first time, and there were epidemics of typhus, typhoid fever, and scarlet fever. Children got sick, children died. So there would be worry about health along with worry about money. And it all would take so much time. That was the crux of the issue. He wrote and underlined twice &#x201c;Loss of time.&#x201d;</p><p>Charles needed as many hours a day as he could have to do his work. First of all, he had to solicit more experienced naturalists to help him analyze his specimens. Charles had so many kinds of specimens; he was not an expert on every bird, bone, and bug. He had already given out his rare <em>Megatherium </em>bones and his finches and mockingbirds from the Galapagos Islands. But he had more of his collections to distribute to experts, and he had to urge them, coax them, to tell him what they thought. What did he have? Had he found new species? What significance did his finds have, if any?</p><p>As a single man with no family responsibilities, he could meet with these experts, go to scientific meetings, and visit museums and libraries whenever he wanted to. He didn&#x2019;t have to worry about a wife or her relatives dictating how his</p><p>time should be spent.</p><p>Charles felt strongly that he had no time to waste. Near the end of his voyage, he had heard from one of his sisters that Henslow and another old professor of his, Adam Sedgwick, were both very interested in the bones he had sent back. Sedgwick declared his collection &#x201c;above all praise&#x201d; and said that Charles would have &#x201c;a great name among the Naturalists of Europe.&#x201d; Charles found this terribly gratifying and knew that with those endorsements he would continue to work hard on natural history. He wrote, &#x201c;A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.&#x201d; </p><p>Before the voyage, Charles had been a typical natural history collector. In nineteenth-century England, everyone from country parsons to teenage girls collected butterflies, flowers, even stuffed birds and fossil bones. Looking at God&#x2019;s wondrous handiwork was a worthwhile avocation, and in some cases, vocation. Collectors tried to amass and describe as many of God&#x2019;s species as possible and hoped to find new crabs, moths, finches, or ferns. And if you were lucky, the new species you discovered would be named after you&#x2014;Charles had a few named after him, including a South American ostrichlike bird, the <em>Rhea darwinii</em>, and a frog that lived in Chile and Argentina, <em>Rhinoderma darwinii.</em></p><p>Although he was pleased to ha...</p></p><h2>Eso: How You and Your Lover Can Give Each Other Hours of Extended Sexual Orgasm</h2><p>Describes and illustrates the physical characteristics of ESO, extended sexual orgasm, and provides step-by-step guidance in attaining ESO, overcoming resistance, and solving emotional and sexual problems</p><p></p><h2>The Watcher&#39;s Guide, Volume 3 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)</h2><p><i>As long as there have been vampires, there has been the Slayer.

In <i>Adventures in Human Being</i>, award-winning author Gavin Francis leads readers on a journey into the human body, offering a guide to its inner workings and a celebration of its marvels. Drawing on his experiences as a surgeon, ER specialist, and family physician, Francis blends stories from the clinic with episodes from medical history, philosophy, and literature to describe the body in sickness and in health, in living and in dying.

Focusing on a castle called Chepstow on the border between England and Wales, acclaimed Medievalists Joseph and Frances Gies offer an exquisite portrait of what day-to-day life was actually like during the era, and of the key role the castle played. The Gieses write eloquently about the many people whose lives revolved around the castle, from the lord and lady to the commoners of the surrounding village. We discover what lords and serfs alike would have worn, eaten, and done for leisure; the songs sung; and the codes of sexual conduct that maintained order. We learn of the essential role of honor in medieval culture, the initiation process undertaken by knights, and how castles attempted to keep the constant threats of outside violence at bay.</p><p>Exhaustively researched and as engaging as any novel, <em>Life in a Medieval Castle</em> is the definitive text for anyone wishing to learn more about this fascinating era.</p>Fiances and Joseph Gies have been writing books about medieval history for thirty years.

She passed away in 2002.PreSchool-Grade 3-This tale drawn from Jewish folklore has been told in many variations, but never so richly. It is a story of relationships, trust, transformations, and optimism, as well as being an entree to Jewish history in Eastern Europe of the 19th-20th century. Grandpa trims away the worn parts of Joseph's baby blanket and uses it to make him a jacket in the first of its many transformations into ever smaller items: a vest, a tie, a handkerchief, and a button as each item in turn becomes worn. When the button is lost, Joseph declares: "'There is just enough material here to make...a wonderful story!'" The story is told with repetitive, rhythmic phrases that children will soon anticipate and join in on. Using colored pencils, watercolors, and possibly other media, Gilman has created a shtetl in a book. Each oversized wood-framed page draws readers closely into the town or into Joseph's house and also below its floor where the mice use each discarded scrap to furnish their own snug home. Shades of warm brown, rust, and gold, accented with bright blue, lend a feeling of nostalgia. Gilman's art is subtle with painterly shading, a skillful use of light and dark, and expressive line. Each page is beautifully composed. While some of the folk characters' expressions are exaggerated, this is, after all, supposed to be funny.<br><i> Marcia Posner, Federation of New York and the Jewish Book Council, New York City</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black Musical Theatre: From Coontown to Dreamgirls</h2><p>Looks at Black performers, composers, lyricists, choreographers, and directors, and traces the development of the Black theater from the turn of the century to the present</p><p>Black Musical Theatre begins its historical survey with Clorindy, the Origin of the Cakewalk and A Trip to Coontown, in 1898, and concludes with the Broadway smash Dreanigirls, in 1981. The section on the ragtime pianist and composer Eubie Blake and his popular 1920s show, Shuffle Along, attests to early black influence in American musical theater. Prior to the 1920s, black musical theater was enriched by Walker and Williams, Cole and Johnson, Miller and Lyles, and Ernest Hogan. White producers and composers such as George Gershwin (Porgy and Bess) who were deeply involved in black musicals are given due coverage, and the problems inherent in relations with whites over such issues as stereotyping are fully examined. Other political issues such as the lack of social criticism in white-created musicals is treated with perception. The photographs are often chosen from the Billy Rose Theatre Collection, New York Public Library, and add a visual dimension to the exposition that will be of great value to students of musical history. Costume and scenery designers will also appreciate the stills from Hot Mikado, Carmen Jones, and The Wiz. Other illustrations include sheet music, performers (such as Louis Armstrong), and programs. The tap dance, gospel songs, jazz. and other elements of musical theater were perfected by black performers and composers, and were an intricate part of the Broadway tradition that has since extended its influence into television, popular music, and film. Both academic and public libraries should buy their share of this readable, socially relevant, thoroughly researched book. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>Theater historian Woll's scholarly yet entertaining account of the rise, fall, and resurrection of the black musical fleshes out a neglected but vital aspect of American musical theater. Woll starts with minstrel shows and "coon songs" and follows the development of the musical through the great shows of the twenties to current-day blockbusters like Ain't Misbehavin' . Throughout, stage history has paralleled social history; a subtext of discrimination against black performers and authors underscores Woll's splendid re-creation of the world of Cole and Johnson, Williams and Walker, Florence Mills, and countless others. A discography would have been welcome, but this is a minor complaint about a well-researched and admirable work. Essential for all theater and black studies collections.

He edited the 1989 Editions Flammarion edition of the Complete Works of Rimbaud. Librairie Arth�me Fayard published in 1998 his biography of St�phane Mallarm�, the first comprehensive biography of the poet in French in almost fifty years.In the foreword to his new biography of poet-adventurer Rimbaud, Steinmetz, who edited the 1989 Editions Flammarion Complete Works of Rimbaud, asserts that, as a narrator, he will allow Rimbaud's actions to give birth to their own significance, rather than overburden them with qualification. In practice, Steinmetz has as much difficulty refraining from laudatory remarks as a sportscaster. At a certain point in the development of his poetic style, Rimbaud quits the use of references to the Parisian Commune, which had saturated much of his previous work; according to Steinmetz, he is suddenly "on the same wavelength as eternity." The poet's constant irritation with his family is always considered just; his lack of sympathy for his lover, Paul Verlaine, is seen as the rightful rejection of a pathetic companion. Steinmetz allows as little interpretive leeway as conceivable in recounting a life that seethes with contradiction, spontaneity and violent longing. To his credit, Steinmetz is able to communicate the alternating spasms of self-love and self-loathing that seem to have animated Rimbaud's existence and driven him to devour, then abandon, creative media from poetry, to carnal desire, to compulsive travel. Yet, for all Steinmetz's enthusiasm, the real Rimbaud remains, as the biographer himself repeatedly asserts, "someone who cannot be found." These pages constitute a vivid retelling of the Rimbaud legend; but Rimbaud the human being, almost completely obscured by that legend, continues to evade definition. (Mar.)Forecast: Graham Robb's "robust" but equally mythologizing Rimbaud came out last October. Steinmetz, however, does a better job of communicating the sense of an erratic but exciting mind at work. This should appeal to readers of poetry and French literature.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Fun-Time Phonics Workbook - The Simplest, Most Effective Way to Learn to Read (Grades PreK-2)</h2><p>Finally, a fun, colorful, easy-to-use phonics program that is comprehension centered!

Leading NATO into the first war of its fifty-year existence, America sought to carve out a new role both for the alliance and for itself in establishing a new and more moral world order. Yet like the other crises of the 1990s -- in Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, and Rwanda -- this war has revealed the limits of America&#39;s power to shape the world and, especially, its power to impose its values on others. When NATO&#39;s eleven-week air campaign was suspended, the conflict moved into a new and dangerous phase, for these issues persist in a fast-moving context of war and peace. In Kosovo Crossing, bestselling author David Fromkin, whose works on global history and American foreign policy have won wide acclaim, turns his attention to the sobering implications of the clash between American ideals and Balkan realities. His incisive analysis reveals the uses and the limits of military power in the world today and the new paths that American leaders must explore to advance American values. To a great extent, he argues, both sides in this Balkan conflict have been dealing with the aftermath of the First World War: Yugoslavia was carved out of the remains of the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires (with no resolution of the ethnic strife among its peoples); and America in the 1990s has adopted as its unofficial creed the ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who preached a new world order based on humanitarian principles. Fromkin traces the impact of this history on current decision making in Belgrade and Washington, and points us toward a new understanding of where we go from here. Kosovo Crossing eloquently describes the role the Balkan war has played in the larger drama of American power abroad and the effect its emerging outcome will have on our future. In the tradition of A Peace to End All Peace, Fromkin&#39;s magisterial history of the making of the Middle East, this book offers the necessary perspective to understand the political and military quandaries facing the United States on the threshold of a new century.</p><p>David Fromkin's instant analysis arrived in bookshelves less than two months after the completion of NATO's 11-week air campaign against the Serbian government led by Slobodan Milosevic. As such, it deals much more with the historical factors that led to Operation Allied Forces than with the military action itself. In addition to providing a very broad overview to about three millennia of Balkan history, Fromkin tracks the growth of the United States as a world power in the 20th century and its mixed record of interventionism, then shows how those two tracks collided in the aftermath of the First World War, and again shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its satellite regimes in the late 1980s. "The positions taken by President Clinton in the 1990s," Fromkin argues, "are those staked out for the United States by President Wilson eighty years ago." He goes on to assert that those positions, which require the United States to support Eastern European "self-determination" in principle but oppose actual nationalist movements that it fears would undermine the region's political stability, have not--and likely never will--succeed in the long run. "Serbia's apparent surrender in June 1999 was a triumph for the United States. But it was the easy part," Fromkin concludes. But ending the war is not the same thing as bringing about peace. "It may be a long time, if ever, before we are justified in breaking open the champagne." <i>--Ron Hogan</i><b>David Fromkin</b> is a professor of history and international relations at Boston University and is the author of numerous books on global history, including <i>A Peace to End All Peace, In the Time of the Americans,</i> and <i>The Way of the World.</i> A frequent contributor to The <i>New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Foreign Affairs,</i> and other publications, he lives in New York City.</p><h2>The Complete Works of Chuang Tzu</h2><p>This is one of the most justly celebrated texts of the Chinese tradition - impressive for both its bold philosophical imagination and its striking literary style.

He searched the Bible for principles on how to handle money and possessions. He applied these truths to his own finances and became financially within ten years. Eager to share these powerful ideas, Dayton founded Crown Ministries in 1985 and developed a remarkably effective small-group financial study. He has served full time as an unpaid volunteer and CEO of Crown since its inception. September 2000 brought the merger of Crown Ministries and Christian Financial Concepts, founded by Larry Burkett. The new group was named Crown Financial Ministries, and continues today as the world s largest financial ministry. Dayton graduated from the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University in 1967 and served two and one-half years as a naval officer. Before starting his ministry, he developed a successful restaurant in Orlando, Florida. In 1972, he began his commercial real estate development career. Howard and Beverly Dayton were married in 1971. They currently have two children and live in Gainesville, Georgia. Dayton is the author of several books, including Your Money Counts, Free and Clear, and Your Money Map.</p><h2>Gospel in the Stars</h2><p>This fully illustrated volume will captivate the interest of those pursuing a study of astronomy and of Bible students seeking reinforcing truths concerning the unity of creation and revelation.</p><p>Did God arrange the stars in the sky to spell out his ultimate plans for the human race? Such is the conclusion of this curious book, first published in 1882 as an attempt to reconcile Christianity with the public fascination with astrology... a fascination that endures today. <p> In this profusely illustrated volume, discover the connections between the signs of the Zodiac and Christian symbolism--Leo the lion represents Jesus, for instance; the Gemini twins signify both the relationship of Adam and Eve as well as God's relationship with his church. Building upon this language of the stars, the author demonstrates the truth of God's "one plan and purpose of Redemption for fallen man."</p>Joseph A. Seiss (1823-1904) was one of the most effective and popular Lutheran preachers of the nineteenth century. In addition to his pastoral duties, he was active as a lecturer and writer.

His regular correspondence, beginning in 1767, with two distinguished naturalists, Thomas Pennant and the Honourable Daines Barrington, forms the basis of &#34;The Natural History of Selborne&#34;. The fascination of the book lies in the magic of its prose and the vividness of its description, which have earned it the distinction of being the only work on natural history to have received equal acclaim as a masterpiece of English literature.</p><p></p><h2>Pastel Painting Step-By-Step</h2><p>This is a practical and comprehensive guide for all soft pastel painting enthusiasts, from the beginner to the experienced artist.

He grows up and moves on, but he is forever changed by the cruel and brutal nature of the act. It lights a fire deep within him that burns white and cold, a quiet flame just waiting to ignite.

The instrument of revenge is Bliss, a killer of killers, the most feared of assassins. Bliss is a Reaper, a lethal tool to be applied toward the ultimate end, but he is also a man with a personal vendetta. <br> <br> Hardened by their pasts, Louis and Angel decide to strike back. While they form a camaraderie that brings them solace, it offers them no shelter from the fate that stalks them. When they mysteriously disappear, their friends are forced to band together to find them. They are led by private detective Charlie Parker, a killer himself, a Reaper in waiting. <br> <br> Connolly's triumphant prose and unerring rendering of his tortured characters mesmerize and chill. He creates a world where everyone is corrupt, murderers go unpunished, but betrayals are always avenged.

Some are obvious: the man who kills his girlfriend, then takes his own life, either out of remorse or because of his own inability to face the consequences of his actions; or the tit-for-tat murders of hoodlums, gangsters, drug dealers, each killing leading inexorably to another as the violence escalates. One death invites the next, extending a pale hand in greeting, grinning as the ax falls, the blade cuts. There is a chain of events that can easily be reconstructed, a clear trail for the law to follow.</p><p>But there are other killings that are harder to connect, the links between them obscured by great distances, by the passage of years, by the layering of this honeycomb world as time folds softly upon itself.</p><p>The honeycomb world does not hide secrets: it stores them. It is a repository of buried memories, of half-forgotten acts.</p><p>In the honeycomb world, everything is connected.<b></b></p><p><b>* * *</b></p><p>The St. Daniil sat on Brightwater Court, not far from the cavernous dinner clubs on Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue where couples of all ages danced to music in Russian, Spanish, and English, ate Russian food, shared vodka and wine, and watched stage shows that would not have been out of place in some of the more modest Reno hotels, or on a cruise ship, yet the St. Daniil was far enough away from them to render itself distinct in any number of ways. The building that it occupied overlooked the ocean, and the boardwalk with its principal trio of restaurants, the Volna, the Tatiana, and the Winter Garden, now screened to protect their patrons from the cool sea breeze and the stinging sands. Nearby was the Brighton playground, where, during the day, old men sat at stone tables playing cards while children cavorted nearby, the young and the not-so-young united together in the same space. New condos had sprung up to the east and west, part of the transformation that Brighton Beach had undergone in recent years.</p><p>But the St. Daniil belonged to an older dispensation, a different Brighton Beach, one occupied by the kind of businesses that made their money from those who were on nodding terms with poverty: check-cashing services that took 25 percent of every check cashed, then offered loans at a similar monthly rate to cover the shortfall; discount stores that sold cheap crockery with cracked glaze, and firetrap Christmas decorations all year round; former mom-and-pop grocery stores that were now run by the kind of men who looked like they might have the remains of mom and pop rotting in their cellars; laundromats frequented by men who smelt of the streets and who would routinely strip down to filthy shorts and sit, nearly naked, waiting for their clothes to wash before giving them a single desultory spin in the dryer (for every quarter counted) and then dress in the still-damp clothes, folding the rest into plastic garbage bags and venturing back onto the streets, their garments steaming slightly in the air; pawnshops that did a steady trade in redeemed and unredeemed items, for there was always someone willing to benefit from the misfortune of another; and storefronts with no name above the window and only a battered counter inside, the shadowy business conducted within of no interest to those who needed to be told its nature. Most of those places were gone now, relegated to side streets, to less desirable neighborhoods, pushed farther and farther back from the avenue and the sea, although those who needed their services would always know where to find them.</p><p>The St. Daniil remained, though. It endured. The St. Daniil was a club, although it was strictly private and had little in common with its glitzier counterparts on the avenue. Accessed through a steel-caged door, it occupied the basement of an old brownstone building surrounded by other brownstones of similar vintage although, while its neighbors had been cleaned up, the edifice occupied by the St. Daniil had not. It had once formed the main entrance to a larger complex, but changes to the internal structure of the buildings had isolated the St. Daniil between two significantly more attractive apartment blocks. The club's home now squatted in the middle of them like some poor relation that had muscled in on a family photo, unashamed of its ignominy.</p><p>Above the St. Daniil was a warren of small apartments, some big enough to be occupied by entire families, others small enough to accommodate only an individual, and one, at that, for whom space mattered less than privacy and anonymity. Nobody lived in those apartments now, not willingly. Some were used for storage: booze, cigarettes, electrical goods, assorted contraband. The rest acted as temporary quarters for young -- sometimes very young -- prostitutes and, when required, their clients. One or two of the rooms were marginally better furnished and maintained than others, and contained video cameras and recording equipment for the making of pornographic films.</p><p>Although it was known as the St. Daniil, the club did not have an official name. A plate beside the door read "Private Members Social Club" in English and Cyrillic, but it was not the kind of place where anyone went to be sociable. There was a bar there, but few lingered at it, and those who did stuck mostly to coff ee and killed time while waiting for errands to run, vig to collect, bones to break. A TV above the bar showed pirated DVDs, old hockey games, sometimes porn or, late at night, when all business had been conducted, film of Russian troops in Chechnya engaging in reprisals against their enemies, real or perceived. Worn hemispherical vinyl booths lined the walls, with scuff ed tables at their center, relics of a time when this really was a social club, a place where men could talk of the old country and share the newspapers that had arrived in the mail or in the suitcases of visitors and immigrants. The decor consisted mainly of framed copies of Soviet posters from the 1940s, bought for five bucks at RBC Video on Brighton Beach Avenue.</p><p>For a time, the police had kept watch on the club, but they had been unable to access it in order to plant a bug, and a wiretap on the phones had expired without anything useful being learned. Any business of consequence was, they suspected, now conducted on throwaway cellphones, the phones replaced religiously at the end of every week. Two raids by vice on the building through the doorway above the club had scored only a couple of johns and a handful of weary whores, few of whom had English and fewer of whom had papers. No pimps were ever apprehended, and the women, the cops knew, were easily replaced.</p><p>On those nights, the door to the St. Daniil had remained firmly closed, and when the cops finally gained entry to it they had found only a bored bartender and a pair of ancient, toothless Russians playing poker for matchsticks.</p><p>It was a mid-October evening. The light outside had long faded and only a single booth in the club was occupied. The man seated there was a Ukrainian known as the Priest. He had studied in an Orthodox seminary for three years before discovering his true vocation, which lay primarily in providing the kinds of services for which priests were usually required to off er forgiveness. The club's unofficial name was a testament to the Priest's brief flirtation with the religious life. The St. Daniil monastery was Moscow's oldest cloister, a stronghold of the Orthodox faith even during the worst excesses of the Communist era, when many of its priests had become martyrs and the remains of St. Daniil himself had been smuggled to America in order to save them from harm.</p><p>Unlike many of those who worked for him, the Priest spoke English with hardly a trace of an accent. He had been part of the first influx of immigrants from the Soviet Union, working hard to learn the ways of this new world, and he could still recall a time when Brighton Beach had been nothing but old people living in rent-controlled apartments surrounded by little vacant houses falling into decay, a far cry from the days when this area was a beacon for immigrants and New Yorkers alike anxious to leave the crowded neighborhoods of Brownsville, East New York, and Manhattan's Lower East Side for space in which to live and the feel of sea air in their lungs. He prided himself on his sophistication. He read the <i>Times</i>, not the Post. He went to the theater. When he was in his realm, there was no porn on the TV, no poorly copied DVDs. Instead, it was tuned to BBC World, or sometimes CNN. He did not like Fox News. It looked inward, and he was a man who was always looking at the greater world outside. He drank tea during the day, and only compote, a fruit punch that tasted of plums, at night. He was an ambitious man, a prince who wished to become a king. He paid obeisance to the old men, the ones who had been imprisoned under Stalin, the ones whose fathers had created the criminal enterprise that had now reached its zenith in a land far from their own. But even as he bowed before them, the Priest looked for ways in which they might be undermined. He calculated the strength of potential rivals among his own generation and prepared his people for the inevitable bloodshed, sanctioned or unsanctioned, that would come. Recently, there had been some reversals. The mistakes might have been avoided, but he was not entirely to blame for them. Unfortunately, there were others who did not see it that way. Perhaps, he thought, the bloodshed would have to begin sooner than expected.</p><p>Today had been a bad day, another in a succession of bad days. There had been a problem with the restrooms that morning and the place still stank, even though the diffi culty had apparently been solved once the drain people, from a fi rm trusted by the organization, got on the case. On another day, the Priest might well have left the club and gone elsewhere, but there was business to be conducted and loose ends to be tied...</p></p><h2>Unhooked</h2><p>From &#x201c;talented wordsmith&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) Lisa Maxwell comes a lush, atmospheric fantasy novel filled with twists and turns about a girl who is kidnapped and brought to an island inhabited by fairies, a roguish ship captain, and bloodthirsty beasts.<br><br>For as long as she can remember, Gwendolyn Allister has never had a place to call home.

Her eyes are wide as she stares out the window, but I&#x2019;m not sure she&#x2019;s actually seeing anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; I tell her gently, and she blinks over at me, like she&#x2019;s startled to find me there.<br> <br>My best friend, Olivia, looks up from her phone and peers out the window of the cab to see where we&#x2019;ve stopped. Her brows bunch together as she stares out through the rain. &#x201c;Are you sure this is it, Gwen?&#x201d; she asks, not even bothering to disguise her disappointment.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not really surprised the house doesn&#x2019;t meet Olivia&#x2019;s expectations. She grew up in the sort of place that can only be called an estate. Before my mom decided to move us to London, we actually lived in her family&#x2019;s gatehouse, while my mom worked on commissioned art for Olivia&#x2019;s parents&#x2014;pretty much anything would be a disappointment by comparison. But when I lean over to see the building Olivia&#x2019;s looking at, my stomach sinks.<br> <br>One-Thirty-Three Gloucester Road stands apart from the other brick and stone buildings that crowd the street. Narrow alleys flank either side of its redbrick walls, almost like the other houses don&#x2019;t want to get too close. Its peaked roofline soars at least one story above its flat-roofed neighbors, and its chimneys claw toward the gray sky. A wrought-iron balcony on the third story looks like it&#x2019;s barely holding on to the ivy-covered brick, and one of the windows on the second floor has been boarded up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure this is the address you were given?&#x201d; I ask my mom, who by now has also noticed where we&#x2019;ve stopped.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. think so.&#x201d; Her face betrays only the slightest bit of uncertainty, but her hands shake as she searches through her lumpy oversize bag. It seems like her hands always shake unless she&#x2019;s holding a paintbrush, especially lately.<br> <br>Finally she retrieves a worn envelope and pulls out the contents. A deep crease forms between her brows as she looks over the papers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me see,&#x201d; I say, taking the rumpled sheets when it&#x2019;s clear she&#x2019;s having trouble finding the information she wants. Which is just another sign of how overwhelmed and anxious she&#x2019;s been recently&#x2014;she&#x2019;s looked at those papers so many times in the last few days that they&#x2019;re creased almost to tearing.<br> <br>Ignoring the way she&#x2019;s picking nervously at the hem of her coat, I scan through the narrow script to find the address that&#x2019;s been arranged for us by her newest commission. Then I lean forward and check it with the driver. He gives me a gruff confirmation before opening his door to start helping us with the bags.<br> <br>In the seat next to me, Olivia has gone very still. I think she&#x2019;s suddenly realized her hastily conceived decision to invite herself along to help us move might not turn out quite the way she&#x2019;d expected.<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess this is it,&#x201d; I say, breaking the silence that has overtaken the cab. I hand the envelope back to my mom.<br> <br>Her eyes meet mine as she takes the papers, and her mouth presses into what might be the start of a smile. Her expression is so expectant, and I know she&#x2019;s waiting for me to say something. Because, usually, this is where I&#x2019;d paste on a smile of my own and make the best of things. This time, I just stare back at her.<br> <br>Her expression falters, and she looks away before I do. Without another word, she steps out of the stuffy warmth of the car, pulling the hood of her jacket up against the rain.<br> <br>But I don&#x2019;t follow her. Not right away.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m used to ending up in all sorts of odd places&#x2014;a trailer park in Sedona, a shacklike cottage near a beach in Costa Rica infested by tiny lizards (which, thankfully, ate the not-so-tiny bugs), a gorgeous jewel box of a studio apartment in Prague. My life has been a series of poorly timed moves for as long as I can remember. But something about this place has me pausing.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know my parents would let you live with us back in Westport,&#x201d; Olivia whispers when I don&#x2019;t get out of the car. &#x201c;We have plenty of room, and they&#x2019;re never around enough for you to even bother them. You don&#x2019;t have to move. Or live here. I mean, it&#x2019;s less than a year until you&#x2019;re eighteen, and I know we could convince your mom&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>I shake my head before she can say anything more. It&#x2019;s not that her offer isn&#x2019;t tempting. It is&#x2014;too tempting. For the last week I&#x2019;ve been hoping Olivia would offer this exact thing, but now that she&#x2019;s holding out a different future like a lifeline, I can&#x2019;t seem to grab hold. I see the way my mom&#x2019;s slight shoulders are swallowed up by her coat, the way her hands clench nervously as she supervises the driver unloading our bags, and I know I need to stay.<br> <br>&#x201c;You really want to spend our senior year here?&#x201d; Olivia asks, surprise clear in her expression.<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I shake my head. Of course I don&#x2019;t. But I&#x2019;d been stupid to think our life in Westport could last. For the first time since I could remember, I&#x2019;d felt almost at home somewhere. With Olivia&#x2019;s friendship as a shield, I never had to prove myself like I had in so many other places. I&#x2019;d almost felt like I finally belonged.<br> <br>But even if I could convince my mom to let me go back with Olivia&#x2014;which is more than doubtful&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t just leave her.<br> <br>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t have anyone else,&#x201d; I explain to Olivia for the thousandth time. And neither do I.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t give up your life for her, Gwen.&#x201d; Olivia&#x2019;s voice is gentle, like it always is when she makes this argument.<br> <br>And I get it, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;I know. I won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I say, trying to convince myself as much as her. &#x201c;But I need to make sure she&#x2019;s settled here. I have to know she&#x2019;s okay before I leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>Olivia stares at me with those bottle-green eyes that see more than most give her credit for. &#x201c;Your mom might never be okay,&#x201d; she says gently. &#x201c;What about college?&#x201d;<br> <br>I have no idea. &#x201c;I have a year to figure that out,&#x201d; I tell her, which is what I&#x2019;ve also been trying to tell myself. &#x201c;A year to get her ready.&#x201d;<br> <br>Olivia frowns, like she wants to say something more, but she doesn&#x2019;t. She knows me well enough to know when not to push.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s nothing else I can say, so I give Olivia a shrug and get out of the taxi. The air is thick, and the rain feels cool against my cheeks. Even though the driver has already started to take our bags to the front porch, my mom hasn&#x2019;t moved to follow him. She&#x2019;s staring up at the dark facade of the house, like she doesn&#x2019;t even notice the heavy drops falling from the gray sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you go wait on the porch, and I&#x2019;ll help with the bags?&#x201d; I say, nudging her gently in the direction of the house. Her eyes are tight with worry when they meet mine, and for a moment I think she&#x2019;ll argue. But she doesn&#x2019;t. Instead, she fishes some crumpled pound notes out of her purse and offers them to me before she shuffles toward the house.<br> <br>As the driver returns from depositing the last load of our luggage, Olivia still doesn&#x2019;t look like she&#x2019;s going to get out of the car. With her dad&#x2019;s credit card in her wallet, she could be at the airport and on a first-class flight back to her own life before I even unpack. Our whole friendship could be nothing more than a story about this girl I once knew, and I wouldn&#x2019;t blame her at all. It&#x2019;s what people do, isn&#x2019;t it? They move on. They forget.<br> <br>But a second later, Olivia surprises me by climbing out of the car&#x2019;s dry interior. She hitches up her hood and gives me an impish grin before running for the rusted gate. Even with the rain soaking me, I can&#x2019;t help but laugh.<br> <br>By the time I&#x2019;ve paid the driver and I&#x2019;m ready to follow them up the wide steps to the arching front porch, my jacket is completely soaked and my short hair is plastered to my head. But with Olivia waiting, somehow I don&#x2019;t feel quite as cold.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ready?&#x201d; my mom asks once the taxi disappears around the corner. Her hands tremble at her sides, like she&#x2019;s having second thoughts about knocking. Or maybe she&#x2019;s just waiting for my approval. Usually, we&#x2019;d be in this together, but this time I haven&#x2019;t been able to fake it. This time I don&#x2019;t want to.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; my mom says as she knocks on the heavy door. Her voice sounds like she&#x2019;s swallowed something bitter and hard that hasn&#x2019;t quite worked its way down her throat. And I can&#x2019;t tell who the words are meant for. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re safe,&#x201d; she whispers to herself.<br> <br>As we wait for someone to answer, I pretend I didn&#x2019;t hear her.<br> <br>My mom knocks again, this time harder, but it seems like no one is home. Olivia shoots me a doubtful look as we stand huddled in the entry, and I adjust my worn duffel bag on my shoulder and try to look confident. But the truth is, I&#x2019;m not sure what my mom will do if no one answers. She&#x2019;s not exactly good with the unexpected.<br> <br>Then, just as I&#x2019;m about to suggest that we call another taxi, a shuffling comes from within, followed by the mechanical swish-click of locks receding. After the third lock releases, the door lurches open to reveal a small, wizened man with glasses so thick, they make his cloudy eyes appear three times larger than anyone&#x2019;s should be. I&#x2019;m barely five feet, and the man isn&#x2019;t any taller than I am. I can&#x2019;t help but think that if goblins were real, he could almost pass for one.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; His voice grates across my skin as he looks us over. I can only imagine what he&#x2019;s seeing. We make quite a trio with my mother&#x2019;s wild red hair and even wilder, paint-marred clothes; Olivia&#x2019;s classic beauty; and me, in my exhausted and rumpled glory. His eyes rest on me last, and his nose gives an odd twitch. His stare is a little too intense to be comfortable, and from the scowl on his face, I can tell he finds something about me lacking.<br> <br>I glance away and resist the urge to smooth down my soaked jacket.<br> <br>&#x201c;Arrangements have been made for us to lease your flat,&#x201d; my mom says, thrusting the creased papers toward him.<br> <br>The man stares at her for a long, awkward moment before he finally takes them from her outstretched hand. He reads one sheet and then the other, and when he&#x2019;s finished, he glances up at us. With another questioning look at my mom, he jerks his head toward the interior and disappears into the house.<br> <br>My mom follows him without too much hesitation, but Olivia grabs my arm. &#x201c;Are you sure about this?&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course I&#x2019;m not sure. I give her a halfhearted shrug. &#x201c;I guess we should go in,&#x201d; I say instead, avoiding her eyes as I follow my mom into the house.</p><h2>Dreaming the Eagle</h2><p>This is the story of Boudica: the last defender of Celtic culture, the only woman openly to have led her warriors into battle, the only British warrior to stand against Imperial Rome and triumph. But it is also the story of the two men she loved most: the warrior Caradoc and her half-brother Ban.&#34;</p><p><b>Dreaming the Eagle</b> is the first part of the gloriously imagined epic trilogy of the life of Boudica.<p>Boudica means Bringer of Victory (from the early Celtic word "boudeg"). She is the last defender of the Celtic culture in Britain; the only woman openly to lead her warriors into battle and to stand successfully against the might of Imperial Rome -- and triumph.</p><p>It is 33 AD and eleven-year-old Breaca (later named Boudica), the red-haired daughter of one of the leaders of the Eceni tribe, is on the cusp between girl and womanhood. She longs to be a Dreamer, a mystical leader who can foretell the future, but having killed the man who has attacked and killed her mother, she has proven herself a warrior. <b>Dreaming the Eagle</b> is also the story of the two men Boudica loves most: Caradoc, outstanding warrior and inspirational leader; and B�n, her half-brother, who longs to be a warrior, though he is manifestly a Dreamer, possibly the finest in his tribe's history. B�n becomes the Druid whose eventual return to the Celts is Boudica's salvation.</p><p><b>Dreaming the Eagle</b> is full of brilliantly realised, luminous scenes as the narrative sweeps effortlessly from the epic -- where battle scenes are huge, bloody, and action-packed -- to the intimate. Manda Scott plunges us into the unforgettable world of tribal Britain in the years before the Roman invasion: a world of druids and dreamers and the magic of the gods where the natural world is as much a character as any of the people who live within it, a world of warriors who fight for honour as much as victory, a world of passion, courage and spectacular heroism pitched against overwhelming odds.</p><p><b>Dreaming the Eagle</b> stunningly recreates the roots of a story so powerful its impact has lasted through the ages.</p><p><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s amazing to me about this tale of Boudica, Britain&#x2019;s legendary female warrior, is the pitch-perfect fluency with which Manda Scott brings it forth . . . like an eyewitness recounting real events that she saw and participated in. Her reimagining of this age, when the tribes of Britain clashed with the legions of Rome, includes interior monologues, multiple points of view, dreams, visions, ecstasies, and interlocutions with the dead, all of it utterly convincing and compelling. . . . A stunning feat of the imagination and an absolute must-read for lovers of historical fiction.&#x201d; -- Steven Pressfield, author of <b>Tides of War</b> and <b>Gates of Fire</b><br><br><b>Praise for Manda Scott:</b><br>&#x201c;A new voice for a new world . . . and it&#x2019;s thrilling.&#x201d; -- Fay Weldon<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Give Us This Day (The Classic Memoir of the Bataan Death March)</h2><p>Military Book Club Collector&#39;s Edition. 1956 Copyright renewed in 1985. &#34;story of the Battle of Bataan, the infamous march that followed and the brutal inhuman treatment American soldiers endured for three and a half years.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Appalachian Fiddle</h2><p>Fifty-eight grand old fiddle tunes from the mountains of Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky.

But there was another side to this holy Pope who found time to address scores of newlyweds who came to seek his blessing on their marriages. This is the Pius XII who is revealed in <b><i>Dear Newlyweds</i></b>. <br><br><b><i>Dear Newlyweds</i></b> should be placed in the hands of every newly-married couple. It is a book to read, ponder, cherish, and be guided by, all through married life. Newlywed, married, and engaged couples will be inspired and uplifted by Pius XII&#x2019;s explanation of Matrimony and his insight into the practical problems of everyday marriage. <b><i>Dear Newlyweds</i></b> is a book to turn to again and again. It is a sure guide as new difficulties arise&#x2014;problems of discipline in the rearing of children, temptations against fidelity, relationships with elderly parents, and much more! <br><br><b><i>Dear Newlyweds</i></b> combines the solid doctrine of the Roman Magisterium with the pastoral touch of the Angelic shepherd himself. It is Catholic truth digested and perfectly fitted to those who need it most. It is not a haphazard collection of talks, but forms a complete course on Catholic married life.</p><p></p><h2>Homesick (Hebrew Literature)</h2><p>Moving from character to character, perspective to perspective, Homesick is a complex and moving portrait of parallel lives and failing love in a time of permanent war.</p><p>Eshkol Nevo was born in Jerusalem in 1971 and spent his childhood years in Israel and Detroit. He teaches creative writing at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, Tel Aviv University, Sapir College, and the Open University. He has published a collection of short stories, a book of nonfiction, and two novels, both of which have been bestsellers in Israel.Starred Review. In his second book in English translation, popular Israeli novelist Nevo pays tribute to the dynamism of his country, honing in on a handful of neighbors in the town of Mevasseret, just outside Jerusalem, whose Arab inhabitants were displaced in 1948. The novel is narrated from multiple perspectives; each intense personality describes the struggle to embrace the tension of everyday life in Israel and come to terms with the law of the preservation of sadness. Noa and Amir are a young couple&#x2014;he a psychology student and she a photography student&#x2014;adjusting to life together under the same roof; landlords Moshe and Sima in the apartment next door clash over the appropriate religious upbringing of their children. Across the lot a family mourns the loss of a son to the war in Lebanon, and nearby, the Arab Madmonis family faces prejudice on a daily basis. While death and social isolation hover over many scenes, Nevo masterfully explores the dualities of life in Israel, and delicately draws out the hope and love submerged in the hearts of its citizens. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, with <b>The Passion for Gardening</b>, Druse writes about this inspiration, the underlying spirit that is shared by all gardeners. This is not a simple how-to book, but a why-to. Why do we garden? And how are our lives immeasurably enriched by the process? As the world around us grows more chaotic each day, Druse, in rich and thoughtful prose, reminds us to slow down, put a trowel to the earth, and consider the wonders and healing powers of tending a garden. Gardening, he tell us, is an antidote for today&#x2019;s hectic pace.<br><br>In <b>The Passion for Gardening</b>, Druse meditates on the issues close to heart of all gardeners: the notions of giving back and of conservation, of taking risks and the creative process of collaborating with nature and one&#x2019;s community. Along the way, he introduces us to a variety of extraordinary gardeners and their gardens, revealing how they have cultivated their natural spaces and, in turn, have themselves been transformed in the process. Druse visits ten remarkable gardens, including a Michigan landscaper&#x2019;s 60-acre natural habitat, a West Coast garden inspired by &#x201c;the Japanese aesthetic,&#x201d; and Chanticleer, a delightful public estate on Philadelphia&#x2019;s Main Line that Druse dubs &#x201c;a paradise in progress.&#x201d; Of particular note is a special section on Druse&#x2019;s own garden, including an unprecedented view of nature&#x2019;s contribution through the seasons that provides us with a deeper understanding of how gardens truly live.<br><br>With more than 250 dazzling color photographs, as well as practical advice on replanting shrubs and trees, creating garden paths and sculptures, and controlling pests naturally,<b> The Passion for Gardening</b> is an inspirational and intimate look at gardening for a lifetime.</p><p>KEN DRUSE is recognized as one of America&#x2019;s foremost gardening authorities, and has contributed both articles and photographs to numerous gardening publications. His most recent book,<b> Making More Plants</b>, received the 2001 Award of the Year from the Garden Writers Association and was named best book of the year by the American Horticulture Society. He lives and gardens in New Jersey. <br>Visit him at www.kendruse.com.Recreation for a Lifetime<br><br>I met a young horticulturist at a botanical garden recently, and we spent several minutes chatting about the plants she helped to tend. We were meeting on common ground-as two garden lovers-and we both chattered on excitedly, sharing ideas about culture and information about little-known species that we'd both learned to love. But when she mentioned that she grew one of these species on the windowsill of her parents' house, where she lives, and that she hoped someday to have a garden of her own, I suddenly felt every one of my fifty-plus years. I wondered how she viewed me, dreading the idea that she saw me as a contemporary of her father (which I was). I wanted to seem cool, but then I had an awful thought: Good God, I've got houseplants older than this girl!<br><br>I mentioned this encounter to my friend Jill Hagler, who is halfway in age between me and the young gardener. "It's just a state of mind," she assured me. "All gardeners are young at heart." And it's true: all the gardeners I know always seem to have one foot in the future, wondering what gifts they' ll get from the garden tomorrow, next week, and next year. Gardening truly is a lifetime recreation, one that can keep us fresh and on our toes (or on our knees) until the end of our days.<br><br>Among my older-than-the-young-gardener houseplants are twin specimens of the cycad Zamia furfuracea, which were probably five or ten years old when I bought them in 1975. They traveled with me from my first college apartment in Providence, Rhode Island, to Manhattan and then to Brooklyn. Now the twins live in New Jersey, and their longevity helps put our history of gardening together into perspective. Ancestors of these conifers populated the earth for millions of years before flowering plants evolved. The fact that this genus has been around for so long points out how very short thirty, forty, or fifty years is, and how my time on earth spent in the garden is really only an instant in the scheme of things.<br><br>I may call thirty years an instant, but in this age-which might be called the "Age of Impatience"-that span of time may as well be forever to most people. We get impatient if the car in front of us pauses imperceptibly at a red light. We watch the interminable seconds tick away on the microwave, and get irritated if the computer takes a few extra nanoseconds to accomplish a task that, even five years ago, would have seemed incomprehensible. Technology has compressed time so greatly that we have come to expect miracles to be over and done with almost before we even notice they have begun.<br><br>Gardening is an antidote to this manic pace. Gardens aren't created overnight; a good garden takes time to develop, and then can be made and remade, over the course of a lifetime and even into succeeding generations. Plants don't mature in nanoseconds. They follow the pace of the natural world, which for most of time has been the only measure of time: the passage of days and seasons, the annual cycle of death and rebirth. The late May Sarton, whose intimate journals are full of wisdom about life in the garden, wrote: "Everything that slows us down and forces patience, everything that sets us back into the slow cycles of nature, is a help. Gardening is an instrument of grace." Tending a garden can be a continual lesson in letting go, of accepting what is offered and appreciating the moment-because a moment later, what you see could disappear. How many times has some wonderful thing become a casualty of a thunderstorm or been decapitated in an unfortunate dog-walking incident? The list of possible accidents is endless, and even the plants themselves have a built-in brevity: Hemerocallis aren't called daylilies for nothing.<br><br>Unfortunately, many promoters of garden products hope to cash in on our cultural impatience, offering "new" ideas for instant color, instant effect, instant solutions. For many people, quick-kill herbicides in disposable spray bottles have replaced hand-weeding tools; the annoying whine of the electric- or gas-powered blower has largely obliterated the gentle "scccrick" of the rake. Gardening magazines try to be about "The Garden" without getting into the dirty business of "gardening," featuring articles with seductively impossible titles such as "101 Easy Ideas for a No-Maintenance Landscape." One Internet purveyor (now out of business) perhaps epitomized this attitude, offering pre-chilled daffodil and tulip bulbs to plant in the spring for "instant" bloom. The company claimed that this would allay the "sense of failure" gardeners feel when they plant bulbs in the autumn and have to wait months to see the rewards of their efforts.<br><br>This attitude devalues the appeal that gardening holds for many of us. It assumes that making a garden is as simple as putting up Christmas decorations: buy a few gewgaws, plug them in, turn them on, and then move on to the next activity. It promotes decorator gardens full of "colorful plant material," which are "installed" (as if they were appliances) to one-up the Joneses and then ignored until they need to be freshened up and dusted off for the next party. Yes, there will always be fashions, fads, and trends in gardening. We only need to look at a Victorian-era seed catalog to see all the plants that have come and gone and come back into favor again. But gardening itself will never be a fad, as the long-term involvement of so many of us makes amply clear.<br><br>While a beginning gardener might fall for these advertising gambits, anyone who has gardened for even a little while knows that good things don't come easily, and rarely in an instant. What so many jaded marketers fail to imagine is the rich relationship between the gardener and the garden, how dedicated we can be to our favorite pastime. They don't see that many of us actually like getting our hands in the dirt. They don't understand that looking ahead, anticipating future rewards that will sprout from our efforts of the moment, is part of the wonderment of gardening for us. We don't want to get out of the garden in less time. Most of us want more time to spend puttering in our beds. I'd like to ask those garden-product executives: Would you have bothered to learn how to play tennis, or golf, so you could play just one game and then retire your rackets and clubs to the attic?<br><br>Have you ever seen a garden trowel used only once?<br><br>Garden of the Mind<br><br>It is ironic that when the garden we dreamed of creating finally seems finished, the picture keeps changing. Other artists don't have this problem. A painting, a sculpture-these are worked until the creator decides the piece is finished, at which point it doesn't continue to mutate into something else. Displayed in a climate-controlled museum, such a work of art will remain basically unchanged for hundreds of years. But gardeners can't control the climate. On the contrary, it controls us, determining what we can do and how long we can stand to be out there doing it. A garden can't be protected from the elements, since those elements are what it needs to survive. A garden is alive, with plants in different stages of life. Some are growing old and senescent, some reaching a distinguished maturity, and some merely babes in the woods, just starting to spread their branches and roots.<br><br>Because of this endless mutability, gardening-more than any other art-is as much about the process as the end result. It can be disconcerting to visit a garden deemed "historically significant" and fixed in that arbitrary time, as if gardeners of historic importance would not have continued to evolve-ripping up their beds and replanting them based on new knowledge, new plants, even new fashions. How a famous architect chose to arrange a living room might be insightful, but outdoors, the garden is a "living" room that never has a set moment in time.<br><br>"In a garden, you learn that nothing is static," says Juana Flagg, who has gardened on the same Connecticut property for nearly half a century. "There' s no such thing as instant landscaping. It's always changing, never ending."<br><br>When I began the Brooklyn garden described in my book The Natural Shade Garden, I thought I would design it, plant it, and enjoy it. I moved in too late in the fall to do anything outside, so I had all winter to plan and sketch and dream-and I dreamed big. I wanted a folly-a combination classical ruin and summer house. I needed a barbecue area, a dog run, a pond with a bridge. I wanted thousands of different plants-trees and shrubs, vines and groundcovers, annuals, perennials. I wanted it all-all in a backyard measuring 21 by 50 feet.<br><br>Eventually it didn't matter what I got or didn't get, because after ten years, I was still doing it-trying different plants, digging a larger pond, pruning, moving things around. The only thing that slowed down my delighted tinkering was starting another garden somewhere else, after which the one in Brooklyn became a somewhat neglected adolescent. But it was also the babysitter and parent of a number of plants for the new garden in New Jersey, some of which had earlier been part of my rooftop garden in Manhattan. Think of those Zamias, tagging along with me through four gardens.<br><br>Some people grow attached to a piece of land and could never dream of moving elsewhere. It is unlikely that landscape designer Tom Rooks will move from his acres in Michigan, or that Juana Flagg, nearing eighty, will be looking to start a new garden elsewhere. But other gardeners would happily move to a site that appealed to them more than the one they now tend. The longing is often for a garden that has whatever the present one lacks: more sun or more shade; more space, or, as we grow older, perhaps less space; a patch of woods, a meadow, a pond, a stream. Many of us have our "dream gardens," but if that dream ever materializes, the reality of it may not equal our fantasies, and we might begin to long for something el...</p><h2>The Collected Poems of W. S. Merwin: A Library of America Boxed Set</h2><p>Oracular and elegant, W. S. Merwin&#x2019;s poetry reveals a heightened sense of what is essential to human consciousness: the fragile framing of nature, the mysteries of memory and perception, the inescapable fact of our mortality.

Bay Area Style houses exhibit a distinct and frequently dramatic relationship to the out-of-doors while suggesting a feeling of informality. Emerging from the California Craftsman Style, these houses use natural materials, including wood and river stone. <br>Bay Area Style showcases a variety of the most extraordinary homes from this remarkable region and spans more than a century, revealing the development of a rich tradition. These houses capture the spirit of the place and embody the region's unique style. Featured are houses by architectural luminaries Ernest Coxhead, Bernard Maybeck, Julia Morgan, Frank Lloyd Wright, Raphael Soriano, and Charles Moore, among others.<br></p><p>Alan Weintraub is the photographer of Rizzoli's The Architecture of John Lautner and the forthcoming Houses of Frank Lloyd Wright.<br>David Weingarten is a writer and practicing architect in San Francisco.<br>The Bay Area is famous for breathtaking beauty, which over the years has been incorporated into great architectural works, including the houses featured in this book. The Bay Area aesthetic is one that places great emphasis on nature, the out-of-doors, and informality. Natural materials, local woods, and great craftsmanship are exhibited in harmonizing these homes with their natural environments. Yet the architecture is quite unique in its own right, with California-based architects exhibiting an eclectic sense of style and place. From Berkeley Hill to San Mateo, San Francisco Bay to Big Sur, great design is blended into the area's natural beauty. The variety of styles and settings include hillside homes, a studio, a lodge, and Arts and Craft homes with a studied informality or modern and progressive styles in a picturesque context.

There was the location: an impoverished, nuclear waste-riddled area of the American Midwest. There was her mother, a woman who speaks almost entirely in strange riddles and warnings of impending danger. Above all, there was her gun-toting, guitar-riffing, frequently semi-naked father, who underwent a religious conversion on a submarine and found a loophole which saw him approved for the Catholic priesthood by the future Pope Benedict XVI, despite already having a wife and children. When an unexpected crisis forces Lockwood and her husband to move back into her parents&#39; rectory, she must learn to live again with the family&#39;s simmering madness, and to reckon with the dark side of her religious upbringing. Pivoting from the raunchy to the sublime, from the comic to the serious, Priestdaddy is an unforgettable story of how we balance tradition against hard-won identity - and of how, having journeyed in the underworld, we can emerge with our levity and our sense of justice intact. &#39;Destined to be a classic . . . this year&#39;s must-read memoir&#39; Mary Karr, author of The Liars&#39; Club &#39;Irrepressible . . . joyous, funny and filthy . . .

Drawing on Jung's own letters, aphorisms, and other writings, <b>David Rosen</b> examines six crises in Jung's personal development, from childhood revelations and youthful rebellions to his break with Freud and his later work with the I Ching. Rosen discovers many parallels between Jung's natural world of the psyche and that of Taoist philosophy: the integration of opposites; the Great Mother as the origin of all things; the I Ching and synchronicity; the Way of Integrity and individuation; and the need to release the ego and surrender to the Self or Tao.As an increasing number of people turn to Eastern philosophy as a means of handling the many stresses of an increasingly confounding world, this illuminating introduction to both Taoism and Jungian thought provides a valuable spiritual resource for contemporary followers of the Path.</p><p>David H. Rosen, M.D., holds the only American full professorship in Jungian psychology, at Texas A&amp;M University.Jungian concepts such as archetypes and the collective unconscious have become part of our culture's worldview, just as have some principles of Asian philosophies. So the insights in this book combining the two can be expected to intrigue many of today's readers. Indeed, psychoanalyst Rosen's (Transforming Depression) brief analysis of Jung's life in terms of Taoist principles is more an inspirational work than a biography. Jung became fascinated by Chinese religion and philosophy later in life, he explains. Rosen attempts to illuminate Jung's psychic development in terms of the Chinese concept of crisis, expressed by the pictographs for danger and opportunity. Jung's crisis, in Rosen's view, consisted of his break with Freud, with the pre-Freud and Freudian years represented by danger, the post-break years by opportunity. The text here consists mainly of biographical anecdotes juxtaposed with quotes from the Taoist masters Chuang-tzu and Lao-tzu and selections from the I Ching, some of which are more relevant than others. Rosen's approach works best for Jung's years at Bollinger, where the middle-aged and then the older Jung expressed his deepest understandings in stone carvings as well as in words. At Bollinger, Jung, already steeped in ancient lore, lived the life of a Taoist sage as he "integrated yin and yang forces and became a modest person in harmony with nature." <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mega Man 2: Time Keeps Slipping</h2><p>Capcom's famous video game icon is back in the action-packed <i>Mega Man 2: Time Keeps Slipping</i>, collecting issues 5-8 of the hit comic book!<br><br>The evil Dr. Wily has been arrested for his crimes against the world, but how long can the mad genius be held in custody?

It covers the period from the Russian elections of December 2003 to the tragic aftermath of the Beslan school siege in late 2005. The book is an unflinching record of the plight of millions of Russians and a pitiless report on the cynicism and corruption of Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s presidency.<br><br>She interviews people whose lives have been devastated by Putin&#x2019;s policies, including the mothers of children who died in the Beslan siege, those of Russian soldiers maimed in Chechnya then abandoned by the State, and of &#x201c;disappeared&#x201d; young men and women. Elsewhere she meets traumatized and dangerous veterans of the Chechen wars, and a notorious Chechen warlord in his fortified lair.<br><br>Putin is re-elected as President in farcically undemocratic circumstances and yet Western leaders, reliant on Russia&#x2019;s oil and gas reserves, continue to pay him homage. Politkovskaya offers a chilling account of his dismantling of the democratic reforms made in the 1990s. She also criticizes the inability of liberals and democrats to provide a united, effective opposition and a population slow to protest against government legislative outrages.<br><br><b>A Russian Diary</b> is clear-sighted, passionate and marked with the humanity that made Anna Politkovskaya known to many as &#x201c;Russia&#x2019;s lost moral conscience&#x201d; and a heroine to readers throughout the world.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Anna Politkovskaya was a special correspondent for the Russian newspaper <i>Novaya Gazeta</i> and the recipient of many honours for her writing.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>PART ONE<br><br>The Death of Russian Parliamentary Democracy<br><br>December 2003&#x2013;March 2004<br><br>How Did Putin Get ReElected?<br><br>According to the census of october 2002, there are 145.2 million people living in Russia, making us the seventh most populous country in the world. Just under 116 million people, 79.8 percent of the population, describe themselves as ethnically Russian. We have an electorate of 109 million voters.<br><br>December 7, 2003<br><br>The day of the parliamentary elections to the Duma,* the day Putin* began his campaign for reelection as president. In the morning he manifested himself to the peoples of Russia at a polling station. He was cheerful, elated even, and a little nervous. This was unusual: as a rule he is sullen. With a broad smile, he informed those assembled that his beloved Labrador, Connie, had had puppies during the night. &#x201c;Vladimir Vladimirovich was so very worried,&#x201d; Madame Putina intoned from behind her husband. &#x201c;We are in a hurry to get home,&#x201d; she added, anxious to return to the bitch whose impeccable political timing had presented this gift to the United Russia Party.*<br><br>That same morning in Yessentuki, a small resort in the North Caucasus, the first thirteen victims of a terrorist attack on a local train were being buried. It had been the morning train, known as the student train, and young people were on their way to college.<br><br>When, after voting, Putin went over to the journalists, it seemed he would surely express his condolences to the families of the dead. Perhaps even apologize for the fact that the government had once again failed to protect its citizens. Instead he told them how pleased he was about his Labrador&#x2019;s new puppies.<br><br>My friends phoned me. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s really put his foot in it this time. Rus- sian people are never going to vote for United Russia now.&#x201d;<br><br>Around midnight, however, when the results started coming in, initially from the Far East, then from Siberia, the Urals, and so on westward, many people were in a state of shock. All my pro-democracy friends and acquaintances were again calling each other and saying, &#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be true. We voted for Yavlinsky,* even though. . . .&#x201d; Some had voted for Khakamada.*<br><br>By morning there was no more incredulity. Russia, rejecting the lies and arrogance of the democrats, had mutely surrendered herself to Putin. A majority had voted for the phantom United Russia Party, whose sole political program was to support Putin. United Russia had rallied Russia&#x2019;s bureaucrats to its banner&#x2014;all the former Soviet Communist Party and Young Communist League functionaries now employed by myriad government agencies&#x2014;and they had jointly allocated huge sums of money to promote its electoral deceptions.<br><br>Reports we received from the regions show how this was done. Outside one of the polling stations in Saratov, a lady was dispensing free vodka at a table with a banner reading &#x201c;Vote for Tretiak,&#x201d; the United Russia candidate. Tretiak won. The Duma deputies from the entire province were swept away by United Russia candidates, except for a few who switched to the party shortly before the elections. The Saratov election campaign was marked by violence, with candidates not approved of by United Russia being beaten up by &#x201c;unidentified assailants&#x201d; and choosing to pull out of the race. One who continued to campaign against a prominent United Russia candidate twice had plastic bags containing body parts thrown through his window: somebody&#x2019;s ears and a human heart. The province&#x2019;s electoral commission had a hotline to take reports of irregularities during the campaign and the voting, but 80 percent of the calls were simply attempts to blackmail the local utility companies. People threatened not to vote unless their leaking pipes were mended or their radiators repaired. This worked very well. The inhabitants of the Zavod and Lenin districts had their heating and main water supply restored. A number of villages in the Atkar District finally had their electricity and telephones reconnected after several years of waiting. The people were seduced. More than 60 percent of the electorate in the city voted, and in the province the turnout was 53 percent. More than enough for the elections to be valid.<br><br>One of the democrats&#x2019; observers at a polling station in Arkadak noticed people voting twice, once in the booth and a second time by filling out a ballot slip under the direction of the chairman of the local electoral commission. She ran to phone the hotline, but was pulled away from the telephone by her hair.<br><br>Vyacheslav Volodin, one of the main United Russia functionaries who was standing in Balakov, won by a landslide, with 82.9 percent of the vote; an unprecedented victory for a politician devoid of charisma who is renowned only for his incoherent television speeches in support of Putin. He had announced no specific policies to promote the inter- ests of local people. Overall in Saratov Province, United Russia gained 48.2 percent of the vote without feeling the need to publish or defend a manifesto. The Communists got 15.7 percent, the Liberal Democrats* (Vladimir Zhirinovsky&#x2019;s* party) 8.9 percent, the nationalistic Rodina (Motherland) Party* 5.7 percent. The only embarrassment was that more than 10 percent of the votes cast were for &#x201c;None of the above.&#x201d; One-tenth of the voters had come to the polling station, drunk the vodka, and told the lot of them to go to hell.<br><br>According to the National Electoral Commission&#x2019;s figures, over 10 percent more votes were cast in Chechnya,* a territory totally under military control, than there are registered voters.<br><br>St. Petersburg held on to its reputation as Russia&#x2019;s most progressive and democratically inclined city. Even there, though, United Russia gained 31 percent of the vote, Rodina about 14 percent. The democratic Union of Right Forces* and Yabloko* (Apple) Party got only 9 percent each, the Communists 8.5, and the Liberal Democrats 8 percent. Irina Khakamada, Alexander Golov, Igor Artemiev, and Grigorii Tomchin, democrats and liberals well known throughout Russia, went down to ignominious defeat.<br><br>Why? The state authorities are rubbing their hands with glee, tut- tutting and saying that &#x201c;the democrats have only themselves to blame&#x201d; for having lost their link with the people. The authorities suppose that, on the contrary, they now have the people on their side.<br><br>Here are some excerpts from essays written by St. Petersburg students on the topics of &#x201c;How my family views the elections&#x201d; and &#x201c;Will the election of a new Duma help the president in his work?&#x201d;:<br><br>&#x201c;My family has given up voting. They don&#x2019;t believe in elections anymore. The elections will not help the president. All the politicians promise to make life better, but unfortunately . . . I would like more truthfulness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The elections are rubbish. It doesn&#x2019;t matter who gets elected to the Duma because nothing will change, because we don&#x2019;t elect people who are going to improve things in the country, but people who thieve. These elections will help no one&#x2014;neither the president nor ordinary mortals.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Our government is just ridiculous. I wish people weren&#x2019;t so crazy about money, that there was at least some sign of moral principle in our government, and that they would cheat the people as little as possible. The government is the servant of the people. We elect it, not the other way round. To tell the truth, I don&#x2019;t know why we have been asked to write this essay. It has only interrupted our lessons. The government isn&#x2019;t going to read this anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How my family views the elections is they aren&#x2019;t interested in them. All the laws the Duma adopted were senseless and did nothing useful for the people. If all this is not for the people, who is it for?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will the elections help? It is an interesting question. We will have to wait and see. Most likely they won&#x2019;t help in the slightest. I am not a politician, I don&#x2019;t have the education you need for that, but the main thing is that we need to fight corruption. For as long as we have gangsters in the state institutions of our country, life will not get better. Do you know what is going on now in the army? It is just endless bullying. If in the past people used to say that the army made boys into men, now it makes them into cripples. My father says he refuses to let his son go into an army like that. &#x2018;For my son to be a cripple after the army, or even worse&#x2014;to be dead in a ditch somewhere in Chechnya, fighting for who knows what, so that somebody can gain power over this republic?&#x2019; For as long as the present government is in power I can see no way out of the present situation. I do not thank it for my unhappy childhood.&#x201d;<br><br>These read like the thoughts of old people, not the future citizens of New Russia. Here is the real cost of political cynicism&#x2014;rejection by the younger generation.<br><br>December 8<br><br>By morning it is finally clear that, while the left wing has more or less survived, the liberal and democratic &#x201c;right wing&#x201d; has been routed. The Yabloko Party and Grigorii Yavlinsky himself have not made it into the Duma, neither has the Union of Right Forces with Boris Nemtsov and Irina Khakamada, nor any of the independent candidates. There is now almost nobody in the Russian Parliament capable of lobbying for democratic ideals and providing constructive, intelligent opposition to the Kremlin. The triumph of the United Russia Party is not the worst of it, however.<br><br>By the end of the day, with more or less all the votes counted, it is evident that, for the first time since the collapse of the USSR, Russia has particularly favored the extreme nationalists, who promised the voters they would hang all the &#x201c;enemies of Russia.&#x201d;<br><br>This is dreadful, of course, but perhaps only to be ...</p><h2>Lonely Planet Zion &amp; Bryce Canyon National Parks</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet Zion &amp; Bryce Canyon&amp; National Parks </i></b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Steltenkamp </b>is Professor of Religious Studies at Wheeling Jesuit University, Wheeling, West Virginia. He is the author of <i>Black Elk: Holy Man of the Oglala</i> and <i>The Sacred Vision: Native American Religion and Its Practice Today</i>.</p>Based on conversations with Black Elk's surviving friends and relatives, especially his daughter Lucy Looks Twice: a reassessment of the Lakota holy man's religious vocation. Although Black Elk (1863-1950) is usually ranked as the most important Native American religious figure of the past two centuries, almost nothing is known of his life beyond the age of 28, the year that concludes his classic autobiography, Black Elk Speaks (1932; coauthored with John Neihardt). Here, Steltenkamp (Anthropology/Bay Mills Community College) fills in the blanks. Scholars have long been aware that Black Elk converted to Catholicism in 1904--an event often covered up by radical Indian activists--but Steltenkamp makes it clear that this turn to Christianity was neither halfhearted nor coerced but, rather, the culmination of Black Elk's religious search. Lakota religious expression, he finds, is more flexible than previously believed; Black Elk's Catholicism was another way of maintaining his Indian identity. Taking issue with Neihardt's portrait of a pessimistic ex-warrior, Steltenkamp paints the mature Black Elk--whether reciting his rosary, building a chapel, or exhorting other Indians to convert--as patient, kind, hard-working, and happy. While interviewing Black Elk's associates, Steltenkamp hears repeated complaints about how the holy man has been misrepresented by the media, and a second issue emerges: the right of Indians to choose their own way of life, be it Catholic or otherwise, free from pressures by those who wish to freeze their history in 1890, at the massacre at Wounded Knee. A real step forward in American Indian religious studies. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

About the people who built them, and why they were built? Stone walls are not simply monuments to the skill of Yankee farmers. The historical record makes clear that many were built by slaves, Indians, indentured servants, and children.<br><br><em>Sermons in Stone</em> is the surprising history of the walls, a story that begins in the Ice Age and has been shaped by the fencing dilemmas of the nineteenth century, by conflicts between Native Americans and colonists over land use, by America's waves of immigration and suburbanization.

Told from the Japanese perspective, "The Rising Sun is, in the author's words, "a factual saga of people caught up in the flood of the most overwhelming war of mankind, told as it happened--muddled, ennobling, disgraceful, frustrating, full of paradox." <br>In weaving together the historical facts and human drama leading up to and culminating in the war in the Pacific, Toland crafts a riveting and unbiased narrative history. In his Foreword, Toland says that if we are to draw any conclusion from "The Rising Sun, it is "that there are no simple lessons in history, that it is human nature that repeats itself, not history."&#x201c;[It] is quite possibly the most readable, yet informative account of the Pacific war.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Unbelievably rich . . . readable and exciting . . .

The king of cocoa. The guru of ganache. He's Marcel Desaulniers, award-winning cookbook author and chef-owner of Williamsburg, Virginia's renowned restaurant, The Trellis. And he's back with a whole new collection of festive recipes that turn any day into a holiday in <em>Celebrate With Chocolate</em>.</p> <p>Whether you want a romantic cake for two, a "Big-Ass" cake for twenty, cookies, pies, or anything in between, Marcel will show you the way. In <em>Celebrate With Chocolate</em>, he takes you to the outer limits of the chocolate universe, with over-the-top combinations that are surprisingly simple to make.</p> <p>Want something that towers over ordinary chocolate deserts? Try Marcel's "She Ain't Heavy" Chocolate Cake, which stacks three layers of extravagantly light, cocoa-saturated cake, all coated with a smooth cocoa icing. Or for a lunchtime favorite turned sweet treat that satisfies any child from 3 to 103, just pour a glass of milk and check out the Chocolate Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich Cookies. Whatever you make, with Marcel's guidance, this book will keep your ever-growing fan club happy.</p> <p>No holiday is required to <em>Celebrate With Chocolate</em> with Marcel Desaulniers. Just have a true love of chocolate. Don't we all?</p></p><p>Don't let the relatively diminutive size of Marcel Desaulniers's <i>Celebrate with Chocolate</i> fool you. In this age of coffee-table cookbooks, the 45 recipes and 16 pages of color photographs in this book might lull you into thinking that these desserts are simple. But look carefully at the cover and see the important subtitle, <i>Totally Over-the-Top Recipes</i>.<p>The almost 20 pages of clear, easy-to-follow information on equipment, ingredients, and techniques give the confidence needed to tackle projects like the five-page Dancing Gingerbread Men Peppermint Fudge Cake: super-spicy, mildly chocolaty, moist sponge cake layers are separated by voluminous white chocolate mousse mixed with mini chocolate chips and crushed peppermint candy, and then enveloped with a smooth chocolate glaze and topped with dancing gingerbread men. Not exactly child's play. For those not easily intimidated, Desaulniers has a seriously decadent recipe for Granny's Chocolate-and-Walnut-Covered Coffee-Cocoa Marshmallow Squares. When you finally unstick your kitchen, the dense, richly flavored, chewy marshmallow bites will elicit groans of pleasure.</p><p>There are also a few less complicated concoctions such as Bob's Big-Ass Chocolate Brown Sugar and Bourbon Birthday Cake, Double Chocolate Pecan Tart, and the surprisingly easy Cocoa Berry Yogurt Mousse, which comes together in just a few minutes. For the most part, the cakes, cookies, frozen desserts, mousses, candies, and other chocolate treats in <i>Celebrate with Chocolate</i> are not for the faint of heart or the kitchen novice, but if you're seriously into chocolate, and are up for the challenge, let Desaulniers be your guide. <i>--Leora Y.

She lives&nbsp;in Berne, Indiana.Nov 10 Love scrapbooking but find it hard to think of the perfect layout? We all get moments like that when faced with a pile of photographs but with the help of a Cricut diecutting machine and this book you should never be stuck again...well, not for a good long time anyway. Even if, like this reviewer you don&#39;t own a Cricut these simple but delightfully clean-cut and tidy layouts are likely to inspire. I love the way they don&#39;t swamp the photographs with too much bewildering pattern but carry the theme with a few choice words and images. Patterned papers are used, but it is mainly plains in a huge number of shapes and combinations that are used. Another good feature is that the photos themselves are absent from the layout, which is not something I have seen in other scrapbooking books. Usually it is all too easy to get caught up in somebody else&#39;s personal story detracting from the basic idea. There are layouts for most occasions and holidays, organized in month order. Choose from New Year, wedding, Easter, baby, Thanksgiving, Christmas, back to school, vacation etc as well as less often featured events such as Cinco de Mayo and Hanukkah. Following the simple instructions is easy, and there is a helpful list of what you need with each project. You might have to invest in quite a lot of dies if you want to make a lot of different pages, but this book does not make use of the vast array of other scrapbooking paraphernalia that magazines love to list. At the very back is a list of suppliers, but anybody outside the US will need to look elsewhere for their stock. Overall I was impressed with the back-to-basics look at this hobby and anybody else who is tired of the rather overblown look of many scrapbooking layouts will surely agree. * Myshelf.com *</p><h2>Pearls, Girls and Monty Bodkin (Everyman&#39;s Library P G WODEHOUSE)</h2><p>Monty Bodkin has returned to London from Hollywood, leaving Sandy Miller, his secretary there, heartbroken, because Monty loves English hockey international Gertrude Butterwick instead of her.

He lives with his family in Venice, Italy.</p>Walker (<i>The Color Purple</i>; <i>Finding the Green Stone</i>) praises the surroundings that fortify the human experience. In her vision, people do not work their will on the things around them, but rather the people and the universe influence each other: "There is a flower/ At the tip/ Of my nose/ Smelling/ Me./ There is a sky/ At the end/ Of my/ Eye/ Seeing/ Me." Vitale (<i>When the Wind Stops</i>) paints great swaths of sunset sky that glow from the horizon, illuminating the serene face of a dreaming girl who looks as if she would be at home anywhere. "There is a dance/ That lives/ In my bones/ Dancing/ Me," reads the text, as the heroine, charged from within by streams of incandescent energy, leaps and sways in swirls of sunlight that stream out from her fingertips. "There is a story/ At the end/ Of my arms," Walker concludes, "Telling/ Me!" Now a rainbow falls over the girl's face, and creation holds out marvelous possibilities. Smaller versions of herself surround the girl in a frieze: in these miniature images she flies, dives into the waves with a fish and climbs the leaves of an enormous white flower to kiss its face. It's less a story than an illuminated prayer"an expression of gratitude for one girl, all humans and the whole of the cosmos.

Meet John Quincy Adams, eight years old and living on his family farm in 1775. Pa's away at the Congress in Philadelphia but drops in or sends a letter from time to time to keep everyone (characters and readers) informed on the road to independence. With an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction, this book takes on too much: it tells about the Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution, introduces readers to the Adams family, and shows how the war affected their lives on the home front. Meanwhile, the prologue and epilogue fill in the historical background facts, the maps are cluttered with hand-lettered fast facts, and the story sinks under the weight of the information cargo it tries to carry. The book's most successful feature is its artwork: panoramic watercolor paintings that give the period an appealing air and the people real personality. There's an exuberance in the pictures that elevates the text. Despite its flaws, libraries may want to have copies of this on hand for teachers seeking picture books set in the period. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i>As she did in Three Young Pilgrims , Harness here relies as much on her ample storytelling skills as on her impressive artistic abilities to tell this edifying story of John Quincy Adams's early years. The narrative opens in the spring of 1775, as eight-year-old Johnny helps with the chores in his family's Massachusetts farmhouse while his father attends the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. The author chronicles the boy's home life, alluding to the historical events leading up to the outbreak of the American Revolution. The highlights of the war are then accessibly recapped with the help of paintings and illustrated maps embellished with painstakingly lettered notations about key incidents and individuals. Completing the volume, a brief account of Adams's adult years mentions his tour as a diplomat, his single term as the sixth president and his service in the House of Representatives until his death in 1848.

She interprets the techniques in a contemporary way suitable for lay persons who are serious about the spiritual life.</p><p>Mary Margaret Funk is a Benedictine nun of Our Lady of Grace Monastery, Beech Grove, Indiana, USA. From 1994 through 2004, she served as executive director of Monastic Interreligious Dialogue, which fosters dialogue among monastics of the world's religions. In addition to her books <em>Thoughts Matter</em>, <em>Tools Matter</em>, <em>Humility Matters</em>,<em> Islam Is</em>, and <em>Into the Depths</em>, chapters by her have appeared in <em>The Gethsemani Encounter</em>, <em>Benedict's Dharma</em>, <em>Purity of Heart</em>, and <em>Transforming Suffering</em>. Currently she maintains her web page, megfunk.com, to provide further support for her readers.Benedictine nun and former prioress Funk translates the vocabulary of fourth-century Christian mysticism into accessible prose for 20th-century spiritual seekers. Using primarily the writings of the early desert father John Cassian (b. A.D. 356), other Christian mystics and an occasional Eastern religious mystic, Funk, the executive director of Monastic Interreligious Dialogue, explores Cassian's premise that serious knowledge of God involves three renunciations: of one's former way of life, of the thoughts belonging to that former way of life and of one's very idea of God. Most of her text deals with renouncing the thoughts belonging to one's former way of life. Her eight chapters focus on different "thoughts"--food, sex, anger, dejection, acedia (profound weariness of the soul), vainglory (taking credit for good actions) and pride. In each chapter, she shows how such thoughts can interfere with one's knowledge of God. As Funk states: "To renounce one's thoughts may seem out-of-date to a casual observer--harsh, foreboding, even unrelenting. A mind at peace, stilled, available for conscious thinking at will is of major value for those of us who confront chaos, confusion, noise, and numbness as we move into the third millennium." <p></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Blood, Brains &amp; Beer: The Autobiography of David Ogilvy</h2><p>Creator of one of the biggest advertising agencies in the world.

He is also the illustrator of Deloris Jordan and Roslyn M. Jordan's <i>Salt in His Shoes</i> and Spike Lee and Tonya Lewis Lee's <i>Please, Baby, Please</i> and <i>Please, Puppy, Please</i>. Mr. Nelson lives with his family in San Diego, California.A song by children&#x2019;s folk-singer Staines is brought to rollicking life by Nelson&#x2019;s artwork in this howl-along picture book. The refrain begins All God&#x2019;s critters got a place in the choir, / some sing low, some sing higher, / some sing out loud on the telephone wire. The tune then moves into solo and ensemble performances by dogs and cats and cows and hippos and possums and porcupines and on and on, adding their own voices and personalities to the hubbub. In each delightful spread, full-to-bursting with said critters&#x2019; energy, Nelson proves himself to be as adept painting jubilant scenes of barnyard animals raising a ruckus as he is creating the more gravitas-laden artwork for which he is justly celebrated. The oversize type of the lyrics nearly shouts off the page, making this a great choice for groups of excitable singers; but it works just as well on an individual level, allowing children to point out the various animals while mimicking their joyful noise. Be sure to keep this book far, far away at bedtime, though.

With his high cheekbones and aquiline nose, Rivers has cut a handsome figure through the worlds of jazz, film, art and writing since the 1950s, befriending everyone from Frank O'Hara to Willem de Kooning along the way. Billed as a definitive Rivers monograph, this oversized volume from the Corcoran Gallery offers plenty of work to look at, from his early Pop paintings jockeying with those of Johns and Rauschenberg, to his later funky collages. The interpretive and biographical essays by Rose and Serwer are lively and accessible, placing Rivers in a political context as the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, and tracing his adventures from year to year. Finally, the book layers in plenty of photographs capturing the iconoclast as a young man, a middle-aged man and an older man, running his long gauntlet between art and life. 83 full-color and 53 duotone illustrations.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Animal Life: Secrets of the Animal World Revealed</h2><p>More than three thousand full-color photographs, accompanied by detailed captions, sidebars, and explanations, provide a definitive look at the animal kingdom, in a volume, organized by behavioral traits, that examines every aspect of animal behavior, including courtship rituals, family relationships, hunting techniques, feeding habits, and defense mechanisms.</p><p><b>Katie Parsons</b> has a PhD in animal behavior and ecology.

Outer Hebrides, 600 acres . . . Puffins and seals. Apply . . .&#x201d; In this radiant and powerful book, Adam describes, and relives, his love affair with these breathtakingly beautiful islands called the Shiants. Crowned with huge cliffs of black basalt and surrounded by tidal rips, they are wild, dangerous, and dramatic&#x2014;with a long, haunting past. <i>Sea Room</i> celebrates this extraordinary place and shares with us the greatest gift an island can bestow: intimate and profound engagement with the natural world.<br></p><p><b>Adam Nicolson</b> is the author of many books on history, travel, and the environment and a winner of both the Somerset Maugham Award and the British Topography Prize. He lives with his wife and children on a farm in Sussex.<br>For his 21st birthday, Nicolson's father gave him some islands among the Scottish Outer Hebrides, 600 acres worth of land that the elder Nicolson had purchased on a whim in 1937. At various times, the Sussex-based writer recalls, the Shiant islands "have been the most important thing in my life," and he has produced a vivid, meticulously researched paean to his "heartland," examining its geology, its flora and fauna, and its history as he reminisces about his own idylls there. The islands, now uninhabited except by the Nicolsons, are outcroppings of grass and rock and stark black cliffs, surrounded by churning waters that are notoriously difficult to negotiate. Until 1901, they were continuously inhabited for thousands of years by an eighth-century hermit, medieval farmers, Irish Jacobite rebels and others documented by Nicolson. The islands are also an important breeding station for birds, and Nicolson observes the comings and goings of geese, puffins and razorbills. Throughout the book, Nicolson explores the troubling idea of ownership; Hebrideans view English landowners with a mix of resentment and derision, and Nicolson acknowledges that his rights to the islands, like those of previous landlords, are morally ambiguous. His mix of scholarship, reflection and lyrical description brings his beloved atolls to life, and the genre-bending book should win some fans among those interested in nature writing and memoir. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Victory in Spiritual Warfare: Field Guide for Battle - Member Book</h2><p><p><b>Victory in Spiritual Warfare: Field Guide for Battle</b> is an 8-session, adult Bible study.

Parker. </p><p>The toughness is brought to the books by Wolfe's leg man and amanuensis, Archie Goodwin. The structure and ambience of the books is, quite deliberately, very much like the Sherlock Holmes stories that Stout so admired. The house on West 35th Street is as familiar as the sitting room at 221B Baker Street; his cook Fritz pops up as regularly as Mrs. Hudson; and his irritant, Inspector Cramer of the NYPD, serves the same role as several Scotland Yard detectives, notably Inspector Lestrade, did for Holmes. Fair warning: It is safe to read one Nero Wolfe novel, because you will surely like it. It is extremely unsafe to read three, because you will forever be hooked on the delightful characters who populate these perfect books. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Ranma 1/2 (2-in-1 Edition), Vol. 17: Includes Volumes 33 &amp; 34</h2><p>A one-two punch of action and comedy in this madcap martial arts manga by the creator of InuYasha&#x2014;one of the world&#x2019;s top manga creators of all time!<br><br>One day, teenaged martial artist Ranma Saotome went on a training mission with his father and ended up taking a dive into some cursed springs at a legendary training ground in China.

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series,&nbsp;<i>Urusei Yatsura</i>, was serialized in&nbsp;<i>Weekly Shonen Sunday.</i>&nbsp;This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another&#x2014;<i>Maison Ikkoku</i>&nbsp;ran from 1980 to 1987, <i>Ranma </i><i>� </i>from 1987 to 1996, and&nbsp;<i>Inuyasha </i>from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include&nbsp;<i>Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, </i>and<i> One-Pound Gospel.</i><br> <br>Takahashi won the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award twice in her career, once for&nbsp;<i>Urusei Yatsura</i>&nbsp;in 1981 and the second time for <i>Inuyasha </i>in 2002. A majority of the Takahashi canon has been adapted into other media such as anime, live-action TV series, and film.&nbsp;Takahashi's manga, as well as the other formats her work has been adapted into, have continued to delight generations of fans around the world. Distinguished by her wonderfully endearing characters, Takahashi's work adeptly incorporates a wide variety of elements such as comedy, romance, fantasy, and martial arts. While her series are difficult to pin down into one simple genre, the signature style she has created has come to be known as the "Rumic World." Rumiko Takahashi is an artist who truly represents the very best from the world of manga.</p><h2>Dark Water: A gripping serial killer thriller (Detective Erika Foster)</h2><p><b>Beneath the water the body sank rapidly.

For the first time, she tells her story and what she learned, first-hand, about radical Islam in <i>A God Who Hates</i>, a passionate memoir by an outspoken Arabic woman that is also a cautionary tale for the West. She grew up in Syria in a culture ruled by a god who hates women. &#x201c;How can such a culture be anything but barbarous?&#x201d;, Sultan asks. &#x201c;It can&#x2019;t&#x201d;, she concludes &#x201c;because any culture that hates its women can&#x2019;t love anything else.&#x201d; She believes that the god who hates is waging a battle between modernity and barbarism, not a battle between religions. She also knows that it&#x2019;s a battle radical Islam will lose. Condemned by some and praised by others for speaking out, Sultan wants everyone to understand the danger posed by <i>A God Who Hates. <p></p></i></p><p><p>WAFA SULTAN&nbsp;is a Syrian-born American psychiatrist&nbsp;included on&nbsp;<i>Time Magazine's</i><i>&nbsp;</i>list of the&nbsp;100 Most Influential People in the World in 2006. She created a&nbsp;firestorm&nbsp;on Al-Jazeera&nbsp;as the first&nbsp;Arab Muslim woman on that network&nbsp;who demanded to be heard.</p><p>&#x201c;An absorbing book, full of Dickensian details.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Forbes</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wafa Sultan is a great heroine of our times, willing to risk everything to stand up to these immense evils when most people are too fainthearted or politically correct to do so. A God Who Hates should be read closely and studied by the President, European leaders, and all Western policymakers and opinion-shapers -- before it is too late.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robert Spencer, author of the New York Times bestsellers The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) and The Truth About Muhammad</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wafa Sultan experienced firsthand the immense contempt of human dignity Islam harbours, and the unimaginable cruelty Muslim women have to endure on a daily basis, resulting from it. Her compelling book is a touching life story filled with bone chilling examples of what it is like to live in a society that is ruled by Islam and how valuable our Western freedom truly is. It is because brave women like Wafa Sultan have the courage to speak out against this doctrine of hate that we in the West have been forewarned. I hope that everyone reads this book and takes note of the important message it contains. We must defend our precious liberties, our Western freedom and never give in to Islam.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Geert Wilders, member of the Dutch Parliament and leader of the Party for Freedom</i></p><p>&#x201c;With rare courage and candor, Wafa Sultan throws open the shuttered windows on Islam, letting clean, bright sunshine pour into its darkest corners to illuminate Islam from the inside. This is where she lived it, confronted it, and ultimately rejected its sacralized teachings--on women, on marriage, on children, on Christians, on Jews, on freedom of conscience, on war, on world domination--as a humanity-warping pathology based on hate and fear. Such is the fascinating psychological analysis that is the underpinning achievement of <i>A God Who Hates</i>: With unique insight and unstinting compassion, Wafa Sultan, a trained psychiatrist, employs her expertise to put Islam on the couch. The results of her analysis will startle, engage, deepen and transform every reader's understanding of Islam forever.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Diana West, author of The Death of the Grown-Up: How America's Arrested Development is Bringing Down Western Civilization</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wafa Sultan paints a scorching, unforgettable portrait of Syrian Muslim society, especially the degradation of its women, and lyrically appreciates her adopted American homeland, which she calls "the land of dreams." But she also worries that Middle East customs are encroaching on the West and writes with passion to awaken Americans to a menace they barely recognize, much less fear.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Daniel Pipes, Director, Middle East Forum</i></p><p>&#x201c;Like thousands of others, I first encountered Wafa Sultan on a stunning YouTube video. Here was a woman on Al-Jazeer a TV, eloquently and courageously defending Western civilization, individualism and reason against the barbarity and mysticism of radical Islam. Her performance was mesmerizing. She was articulate, self-confident, and outspoken. She stunned the audience, the interviewer and the pathetically out-matched Imam who opposed her. Now Wafa Sultan has written her life story in this powerful book. She exposes the ugliness that is Muslim society in theMiddle East, while unapologetically defending the Western values she adopted when rejecting the religion of Islam. If you want to understand this courageous woman, who continues to fight for her beliefs in spite of death threats, and to understand her views on the conflict between Islam and the West, this is a must read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Yaron Brook, Ph.D., President and Executive Director, The Ayn Rand Institute</i></p></p><h2>The Palladian Ideal</h2><p>The sixteenth-century builder Andrea Palladio of Vicenza was to become one of the most influential architects of all time. His famous and beautiful villas, built in the mainland territories of the Venetian Republic, provided his contemporaries and successors with a model for interpreting antique architecture through complex yet graceful proportion and simple, sometimes stark, ornament. He illustrated his buildings and explained his working methods in his <i>Four Books on Architecture, </i>which went through many editions and translation is; it had enormous influence, particularly in the English-speaking world.<br><br><i>The Palladian Ideal </i>presents several of Palladio's most important country villas, as well as well-known later works by others that continue the Palladian tradition, including Colen Campell's Mereworth Castle and Lord Burlington's Chiswick House in England, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux's Salt Works in France, Karl von Fischer's Prinz-Karl-Palais in Germany, and Thomas Jefferson's Rotunda at the University of Virginia. Also featured are two of Palladio's antique sources, the Roman Forum and Pantheon.

Reading this book is like being at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland-- not at the formal presentations but in the hotel bar afterward, where the microphones are turned off and world-famous business leaders say what they really think. Better still, their confidant, Jeffrey Garten, interprets what they say, telling you how their views relate to each other and the world economy, and noting the many important things left unsaid. A revealing glimpse into the future of business, <i>The Mind of the CEO</i> captures as no other book before it what is in the minds of top business leaders and what it means for all of us.</p><p>Yale Management School dean and <i>BusinessWeek</i> columnist Jeffrey Garten has written a provocative if perhaps mistitled book. Billed as a "journey into the innermost thoughts of corporate titans," <i>The Mind of the CEO</i> is really about Garten's own thoughts. He makes no pretense at being objective, admitting: "I want to talk about the awesome challenges CEOs face as seen through what they said to me and as filtered through my own experiences and my own thoughts."<p> Garten uses his interviews with 40 household names--including Intel's Andy Grove, GE's Jack Welch, PepsiCo's Roger Enrico, and AOL's Steve Case--to articulate his own questions and strategies for CEOs to thrive during the "third Industrial Revolution." He interprets these interviews through the lens of his tenures on Wall Street, at Yale, and as President Clinton's Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade. Among the challenges he analyzes: what CEOs are doing (or must do) to win the Internet wars and meet the challenges of going global, why CEOs must emphasize the "true north" of consistent values, and how a shareholder is different from a stakeholder. With great clarity, he details the demise of several CEOs who resigned under pressure, including Aetna's Richard Huber and Xerox's Richard Thoman, and suggests that "a vision without execution is a hallucination."</p><p> Yet Garten's core concern--and one where he is most passionate--is how to expand the leadership role of CEOs on the world stage. He urges leaders to curb their ethnocentrism and to take more responsibility for creating a world environment in which everyone can prosper. By framing this issue of leaders as world citizens, Garten raises smart and searching questions for a wired world economy. --<i>Barbara Mackoff</i></p>Jeffrey E. Garten is Dean and William S.

In recent decades, however, we have seen the rise of a therapeutic ethic that views Americans as emotionally underdeveloped, psychically frail, and requiring the ministrations of mental health professionals to cope with life's vicissitudes. Being "in touch with one's feelings" and freely expressing them have become paramount personal virtues. Today-with a book for every ailment, a counselor for every crisis, a lawsuit for every grievance, and a TV show for every conceivable problem-we are at risk of degrading our native ability to cope with life's challenges.<br><br>Drawing on established science and common sense, Christina Hoff Sommers and Dr. Sally Satel reveal how "therapism" and the burgeoning trauma industry have come to pervade our lives. Help is offered everywhere under the presumption that we need it: in children's classrooms, the workplace, churches, courtrooms, the media, the military. But with all the "help" comes a host of troubling consequences, including:<br><br>* The myth of stressed-out, homework-burdened, hypercompetitive, and depressed or suicidal schoolchildren in need of therapy and medication<br><br>* The loss of moral bearings in our approach to lying, crime, addiction, and other foibles and vices<br><br>* The unasked-for "grief counselors" who descend on bereaved families, schools, and communities following a tragedy, offering dubious advice while billing plenty of money<br><br>* The expansion of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from an affliction of war veterans to nearly everyone who has experienced a setback <br><br>Intelligent, provocative, and wryly amusing, One Nation Under Therapy demonstrates that "talking about" problems is no substitute for confronting them.<br><br></p><p><br>Praise for The War Against Boys by Christina Hoff Sommers, a New York Times Notable Book of the Year<br><br>"Provocative and controversial . . .

Bond uses her to infiltrate this gang, but once in America the hunter becomes the hunted. Bond is in real danger until help comes from an unlikely quarter.</p><p>Ian Lancaster Fleming was a British journalist, naval intelligence officer, and creator of the fictional British spy, James Bond. Educated at Eton, Sandhurst, and at universities in Switzerland and Germany, Fleming s failure at the Foreign Office entrance exams led to brief careers with Reuters and as a stockbroker before he joined British Naval Intelligence in 1939. As personal assistant to the director, Fleming excelled, and his wartime service provided ample background for his later Bond stories.<p>Fleming s Bond novels and short-story collections are among the best-selling books of all time, and serve as the basis for the highly-successful movie franchise, which has starred such acclaimed actors as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig as James Bond. In addition to the Bond series, Fleming wrote the children s classic Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car.

Slowly the sting slid home into its sheath and the nerves in the poison sac at its base relaxed. The scorpion had decided. Greed had won over fear.</p> <p>Twelve inches away, at the bottom of a sharp slope of sand, the small beetle was concerned only with trudging on towards better pastures than he had found under the thorn bush, and the swift rush of the scorpion down the slope gave him no time to open his wings. The beetle's legs waved in protest as the sharp claw snapped round his body, and then the sting lanced into him from over the scorpion's head and immediately he was dead.</p> <p>After it had killed the beetle the scorpion stood motionless for nearly five minutes. During this time it identified the nature of its prey and again tested the ground and the air for hostile vibrations. Reassured, its fighting claw withdrew from the half-severed beetle and its two small feeding pincers reached out and into the beetle's flesh. Then for an hour, and with extreme fastidiousness, the scorpion ate its victim.</p> <p>The great thorn bush under which the scorpion killed the beetle was quite a landmark in the wide expanse of rolling veld some forty miles south of Kissidougou in the south-western corner of French Guinea. On all horizons there were hills and jungle, but here, over twenty square miles, there was flat rocky ground which was almost desert and amongst the tropical scrub only this one thorn bush, perhaps because there was water deep beneath its roots, had grown to the height of a house and could be picked out from many miles away.</p> <p>The bush grew more or less at the junction of three African states. It was in French Guinea but only about ten miles north of the northernmost tip of Liberia and five miles east of the frontier of Sierra Leone. Across this frontier are the great diamond mines around Sefadu. These are the property of Sierra International, which is part of the powerful mining empire of Afric International, which in turn is a rich capital asset of the British Commonwealth.</p> <p>An hour earlier in its hole among the roots of the great thorn bush the scorpion had been alerted by two sets of vibrations. First there had been the tiny scraping of the beetle's movements, and these belonged to the vibrations which the scorpion immediately recognised and diagnosed. Then there had been a series of incomprehensible thuds round the bush followed by a final heavy quake which had caved in part of the scorpion's hole. These were followed by a soft rhythmic trembling of the ground which was so regular that it soon became a background vibration of no urgency. After a pause the tiny scraping of the beetle had continued, and it was greed for the beetle that, after a day of sheltering from its deadliest enemy, the sun, finally got the upper hand against the scorpion's memory of the other noises and impelled it out of its lair into the filtering moonlight.</p> <p>And now, as it slowly sucked the morsels of beetle-flesh off its feeding pincers, the signal for the scorpion's own death sounded from far away on the eastern horizon, audible to a human, but made up of vibrations which were far outside the range of the scorpion's sensory system.</p> <p>And, a few feet away, a heavy, blunt hand, with bitten finger nails, softly raised a jagged piece of rock. There was no noise, but the scorpion felt a tiny movement in the air above it. At once its fighting claws were up and groping and its sting was erect in the rigid tail, its near-sighted eyes staring up for a sight of the enemy.</p> <p>The heavy stone came down.</p> <p>'Black bastard.'</p> <p>The man watched as the broken insect whipped in its death agony.</p> <p>The man yawned. He got to his knees in the sandy depression against the trunk of the bush where he had been sitting for nearly two hours and, his arms bent protectingly over his head, scrambled out into the open.</p> <p>The noise of the engine which the man had been waiting for, and which had signed the scorpion's death warrant, was louder. As the man stood and stared up the path of the moon, he could just see a clumsy black shape coming fast towards him out of the east and for a moment the moonlight glinted on whirling rotor blades.</p> <p>The man rubbed his hands down the sides of his dirty khaki shorts and moved quickly round the bush to where the rear wheel of a battered motor-cycle protruded from its hiding place. Below the pillion, on either side, there were leather toolboxes. From one of these he extracted a small heavy package which he stowed inside his open shirt against the skin. From the other he took four cheap electric torches and went off with them to where, fifty yards from the big horns bush, there was a clear patch of flat ground about the size of a tennis court. At three corners of the landing ground he screwed the butt end of a torch into the ground and switched it on. Then, the last torch alight in his hand, he took up his position at the fourth corner and waited.</p> <p>The helicopter was moving slowly towards him, not more than a hundred feet from the ground, the big rotor blades idling. It looked like a huge, badly constructed insect. To the man on the ground it seemed, as usual, to be making too much noise.</p> <p>The helicopter paused, pitching slightly, directly over his head. An arm came out of the cockpit and a torch flashed at him. It flashed dot-dash, the morse for A.</p> <p>The man on the ground flashed back a B and a C. He stuck the fourth torch into the ground and moved away, shielding his eyes against the coming whirl of dust. Above him the pitch of the rotor blades flattened imperceptibly and the helicopter settled smoothly into the space between the four torches. The clatter of the engine stopped with a final cough, the tail rotor spun briefly in neutral, and the main rotor blades completed a few awkward revolutions and then drooped to a halt.</p> <p>In the echoing silence, a cricket started to zing in the thorn bush, and somewhere near at hand there was the anxious chirrup of a nightbird.</p> <p>After a pause to let the dust settle, the pilot banged open the door of the cockpit, pushed out a small aluminium ladder and climbed stiffly to the ground. He waited beside his machine while the other man walked round the four corners of the landing ground picking up and dowsing the torches. The pilot was half an hour late at the rendezvous and he was bored at the prospect of listening to the other man's inevitable complaint. He despised all Afrikaners. This one in particular. To a Reichsdeutscher and to a Luftwaffe pilot who had fought under Galland in defence of the Reich they were a bastard race, sly, stupid and ill-bred. Of course this brute had a tricky job, but it was nothing to navigating a helicopter five hundred miles over the jungle in the middle of the night, and then taking it back again.</p> <p>As the other man came up, the pilot half raised his hand in greeting. 'Everything all right?'</p> <p>'I hope so. But you're late again. I shall only just make it through the frontier by first light.'</p> <p>'Magneto trouble. We all have our worries. Thank God there are only thirteen full moons a year. Well, if you've got the stuff let's have it and we'll tank her up and I'll be off.'</p> <p>Without speaking, the man from the diamond mines reached into his shirt and handed over the neat, heavy packet.</p> <p>The pilot took it. It was damp with the sweat from the smuggler's ribs. The pilot dropped it into a side pocket of his trim bush shirt. He put his hand behind him and wiped his fingers on the seat of his shorts.</p> <p>'Good,' he said. He turned towards his machine.</p> <p>'Just a moment,' said the diamond smuggler. There was a sullen note in his voice.</p> <p>The pilot turned back and faced him. He thought: it's the voice of a servant who has screwed himself up to complain about his food. 'Ja. What is it?'</p> <p>'Things are getting too hot. At the mines. I don't like it at all. There's been a big intelligence man down from London. You've read about him. This man Sillitoe. They say he's been hired by the Diamond Corporation. There've been a lot of new regulations and all punishments have been doubled. It's frightened out some of my smaller men. I had to be ruthless and, well, one of them somehow fell into the crusher. That tightened things up a bit. But I've had to pay more. An extra ten per cent. And they're still not satisfied. One of these days those security people are going to get one of my middlemen. And you know these black swine. They can't stand a real beating.' He looked swiftly into the pilot's eyes and then away again. 'For the matter of that I doubt if anyone could stand the sjambok. Not even me.'</p> <p>'So?' said the pilot. He paused. 'Do you want me to pass this threat back to ABC?'</p> <p>'I'm not threatening anyone,' said the other man hastily.' I just want them to know that it's getting tough. They must know it themselves. They must know about this man Sillitoe. And look what the Chairman said in our annual report. He said that our mines were losing more than two million pounds a year through smug-gling and IDE and that it was up to the government to stop it. And what does that mean? It means "stop me"!'</p> <p>'And me,' said the pilot mildly. 'So what do you want? More money?'</p> <p>'Yes,' said the other man stubbornly. 'I want a bigger cut. Twenty per cent more or I'll have to quit.'

Eighteen-year-old Anna Frith tells the story of her remote English village, Eyam, which was infected by the plague in 1666 and where, persuaded by their vicar, the townspeople decided to quarantine themselves.</p><p>Geraldine Brooks's <i>Year of Wonders</i> describes the 17th-century plague that is carried from London to a small Derbyshire village by an itinerant tailor. As villagers begin, one by one, to die, the rest face a choice: do they flee their village in hope of outrunning the plague or do they stay? The lord of the manor and his family pack up and leave. The rector, Michael Mompellion, argues forcefully that the villagers should stay put, isolate themselves from neighboring towns and villages, and prevent the contagion from spreading. His oratory wins the day and the village turns in on itself. Cocooned from the outside world and ravaged by the disease, its inhabitants struggle to retain their humanity in the face of the disaster. The narrator, the young widow Anna Frith, is one of the few who succeeds. With Mompellion and his wife, Elinor, she tends to the dying and battles to prevent her fellow villagers from descending into drink, violence, and superstition. All is complicated by the intense, inexpressible feelings she develops for both the rector and his wife. <i>Year of Wonders</i> sometimes seems anachronistic as historical fiction; Anna and Mompellion occasionally appear to be modern sensibilities unaccountably transferred to 17th-century Derbyshire. However, there is no mistaking the power of Brooks's imagination or the skill with which she constructs her story of ordinary people struggling to cope with extraordinary circumstances. <i>--Nick Rennison, Amazon.co.uk</i>"Geraldine Brooks's <i>Year of Wonders</i> is a wonder indeed: a marriage of language and story unlike anything I have ever read. The novel gives the reader a remarkable glimpse into a 17th century horror, but does so with both compassion and exuberance. Read it for the inventiveness of the language alone -- a genuine treat." (Anita Shreve, author of <i>The Pilot's Wife</i> and <i>The Last Time They Met</i>) <p> "Geraldine Brooks' impressive first novel goes well beyond chronicling the devastation of a plague-ridden village. It leaves us with the memory of vivid characters struggling in timeless human ways with the hardships confronting them-and the memory, too, of an elegant and engaging story." Arthur Golden, author of <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i></p><p>"I honestly cannot recall the last time I read a novel as riveting, haunting, and authentically rendered as <i>Year of Wonders</i>. This book is astonishing, a small wonder itself." (Chris Bohjalian, author of <i>Midwives</i> and <i>Trans-Sister Radio</i>)</p><p>"Witch-like, Geraldine Brooks transports the reader to a small English village of the 1660s where over half the population is succumbing to the plague. As alive as a Breugel painting, <i>Year of Wonders</i>offers the vitality and variety of lives strangely like our own--precious and passionate. An unforgettable read, this splendid novel enriches our human memory of both despair and courage."(Sena Jeter Naslund, author of <i>Ahab's Wife; or, the Star-Gazer</i>)</p></p><h2>The Attributes of God: A Journey into the Father&#39;s Heart</h2><p>the attributes of god: a journey into the fathers heart</p><p></p><h2>Lonely Planet Norway (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet Norway</i></b> is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Read his exclusive guest review of Janie Hibler's <em>The Berry Bible</em>:</strong> <br></p> <p> </p> <p>Washington State is berry country. Every summer for a brief but glorious window of time, my Seattle restaurant kitchens overflow with berry abundance--first the sweet local strawberries, then blueberries, red and golden raspberries, boysenberries, blackberries, and finally, the wild huckleberries we buy from foragers, treasured in the restaurants for syrups, jams, and sauces. Berries are the sweet source of many purple-stained memories, like picking wild blackberries with my daughter, Loretta, when she was a kid, and slamming out hundreds of summer berry crisps after hours in the Palace Kitchen one year for the Bite of Seattle.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m delighted by this AmazonEncore edition of Janie Hibler&#x2019;s Northwest classic, <em>The Berry Bible</em>. A bible it is indeed--every berry under the sun is included here, from cloudberries and currants to cape gooseberries and salmonberries. Read up on the history, habitat, and health benefits of each berry before diving into the recipes where berries are used in every course, from soups and entr�es to drinks and desserts... even barbecue sauce.</p> <p>Janie has studded the book with berry-relevant stories, anecdotes, and folklore. You can pick up some fabulous facts along the way. Did you know it takes 80 pounds of raspberries to make one 375 ml bottle of Framboise?</p> <p>My wife Jackie and I like to put up a batch or two of my Mom&#x2019;s easy freezer strawberry jam (right on the back of the pectin box!), but I think Janie&#x2019;s excellent chapter on berry jams, jellies, pickles, and preserves will extend our repertoire this summer.</p> <p>Now I&#x2019;m going to head out to the deck with a Strawberry Mojito in one hand and my <em>Berry Bible</em> in the other to solve the big question--which dessert recipe to try first?

Amending our lack of berry-smarts, Janie Hibler's <em>The Berry Bible</em> presents a definitive guide, with over 200 recipes using cultivated, wild, fresh, and frozen berries--from well-known types such as blueberries and raspberries (and their related varieties), to lesser known kinds, like the cloudberry and manzanita, and apple-like fruit enjoyed traditionally by Native Americans. The recipes cover a wide range of easily produced dishes, such as Morning Glory Muffins with Blackberries and Pork Tenderloin Salad with Warm Strawberry Dressing, and also include formulas for smoothies, cocktails, condiments like chutney, and homemade berry liqueurs such as Madame Rose Blan'&#x2019;s Cr�me de Cassis. What makes the book a particularly valuable kitchen resource, however, is Hibler's A to Z berry encyclopedia, a section that, in addition to providing nomenclature, history, habitat, and classification information, also offers picking, buying, storing, and cooking advice.

Alexandra Petri has auditioned for <i>America&#x2019;s Next Top Model</i>. Afraid of looking like an idiot? Alexandra Petri lost <i>Jeopardy!</i> by answering &#x201c;Who is that dude?&#x201d; on national TV. Afraid of bad jokes? Alexandra Petri won an international pun championship.<br><br>Petri has been a debutante, reenacted the Civil War, and fended off suitors at a <i>Star Wars</i> convention while wearing a Jabba the Hutt suit. One time, she let some cult members she met on the street baptize her, just to be polite. She&#x2019;s a connoisseur of the kind of awkwardness that most people spend whole lifetimes trying to avoid. If John Hodgman and Amy Sedaris had a baby...they would never let Petri babysit it.<br><br>But Petri is here to tell you: Everything you fear is not so bad. Trust her. She&#x2019;s tried it. And in the course of her misadventures, she&#x2019;s learned that there are worse things out there than awkwardness&#x2014;and that interesting things start to happen when you stop caring what people think.</p><p>Some people are born awkward. Some achieve awkwardness. Some have awkwardness thrust upon them. <b>Alexandra Petri</b> is all three. She is a <i>Washington Post</i> columnist and blogger, an International Pun Champion, a playwright, and a <i>Jeopardy!</i> loser, and she&#x2019;s been on your TV a couple of times. She is also a congressman&#x2019;s kid, if that will make you buy this book! When she remembers, she does stand-up comedy too, but she&#x2019;s been locked in her apartment for the past nine months making this book for you and hissing when exposed to sunlight.<b>FLOPPER<br><br></b><br> I am afraid of many things. Drowning, fire, the disapproval of strangers on the Internet, that I&#x2019;ll be hit by a bus without having had a chance to clear my browser history, that one day everyone else on the subway will suddenly be able to hear what I am thinking and turn on me. You know, the usuals. <br><br> One thing I&#x2019;m not afraid of? Looking like an idiot. <br><br> See, I knew I was a writer. That was protection. No matter where I went, no matter what I did, I could turn it into a story. Fall through a hole in the sidewalk? Story. Make the worst Final Jeopardy! wager of all time? Story. Anger the lord of the ocean, stab a one-eyed guy, and get very, very lost on my way home to Ithaca? <i>Epic </i>story. <br><br> Those were the two things I knew about myself: that I was a writer, and that I didn&#x2019;t mind looking stupid. Growing up, you fig�ure out pretty quickly which of your friends is the person who doesn&#x2019;t mind looking like an idiot, and that was me, hands down. I was the one going over to strangers and asking if the mothership had landed. I was the one standing in an airport with a giant foam cow hat on my head, accordion open, ready to greet friends as they landed, and not even because I&#x2019;d lost a bet. Mortification was a poi�son to which I had built up immunity after years of exposure. Be�sides, it was much less embarrassing to <i>be </i>me than to have to stand next to me and admit you were <i>with </i>me. <br><br> And the writer in me had noticed that the bigger of an idiot you appeared to be, the better the story was. Nobody wants to hear, &#x201c;And everything went smoothly, just exactly according to plan.&#x201d; Something had to go wrong. You had to trip up. That was where the excitement lay. <br><br> I collected experiences the way some people collect old coins or commemorative stamps. <br><br> One year, for fun, I called the ExtenZe male enhancement ho�tline every day for a month, with different voices, just to see what would happen. (What happened, if you want to know, was that Phoebe, who worked the dinner shift, got annoyed when I identified myself as Franklin Delano Roosevelt (a fun fact about the ExtenZe male enhancement hotline is that they make you identify yourself before you start your call) and threatened to transfer me to the police.)<br><br> All of this seemed to be leading to some kind of grand adventure. I sat there, glumly, waiting for a wizard to drop by the house and invite me to steal dragon-gold, or a wise old man in a brown hoodie to offer to teach me the ways of the Force. But no one showed. I would have to strike out on my own. <br><br> What was a field in which a willingness to look foolish might come in handy? <br><br> Of course! Reality television. <br><br> Like anyone growing up after 1980, I always had the dim, nag�ging sense that I was supposed to be famous for something. A cer�tain measure of fame just seems like our birthright these days, next to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Food, shelter, Wi-fi, and the sense that someone&#x2019;s watching; these are the modern re�quirements for survival. The only thing more terrifying than the feeling you&#x2019;re being watched is the feeling that you&#x2019;re not. Privacy is just an uncomfortable reminder that you&#x2019;re not a celebrity.<br><br> My portion of fame, I knew, was waiting somewhere, neatly la�beled in a holding facility. To claim it, all I&#x2019;d have to do would be fill out some sort of form and show up in the designated audition city. And until that moment it was my right, as an American, to stare at the television and mutter, &#x201c;I could do that.&#x201d; <br><br> If I were being really honest with myself, these people I saw compet�ing on television all possessed skills that I lacked&#x2014;whether on <i>Amer�ican Idol </i>or <i>America&#x2019;s Got Talent </i>or even <i>America&#x2019;s Most Wanted</i>. I could hold a tune, but only the way you hold a stranger&#x2019;s cat: not closely and not long (not to mention the strange yowling noises). I Got some Talents, all right&#x2014;excellent grammar, for one&#x2014;but they weren&#x2019;t the kind of thing that would exactly sing on the national stage. Whenever I tried to &#x201c;smize,&#x201d; model-style, people asked if I&#x2019;d been possessed by an ancient and evil spirit. I had never murdered anyone, to the best of my knowledge, and if I did I would certainly not elude capture for long. <br><br> But there are always two ways of making it on the air: to be spec�tacular, and to be spectacularly bad. The second group was more fun to watch anyway. Why be Kelly Clarkson or Carrie Underwood or that one ventriloquist guy whose puppets all seemed oddly racist (get new dummies, Terry Fator! Then you won&#x2019;t have to sit there with a pained expression while they rant about the people taking our jobs), when you could be short, sweatshirted William Hung, wrangling his painfully earnest way through &#x201c;She Bangs!&#x201d; or Leo�nid the Magnificent, dropping his equipment as the big red X&#x2019;s buzzed above him, weeping profusely and promising that &#x201c;next time, I will be perfect&#x201d;? Sure, on one path lay Kelly&#x2019;s international fame and Terry&#x2019;s bucket loads of gold, but on the other lay William&#x2019;s Christmas album, <i>Hung For The Holidays</i>. Now <i>that </i>was what I called a career trajectory. <i>That </i>was a story!<br><br> And that was going to be my way in.<br><br> I was going to seek failure out&#x2014; n the national stage, with a glowing neon X attached.<br><br> The plan was simple. I just had to become dramatically, unques�tionably, horrifically bad at something. I had to get myself in front of the judges and flop like no one they&#x2019;d seen before. <br><br> Maybe, if I worked hard, I could become just as earth-shatteringly terrible as my idols and wind up on the air. It certainly seemed like my best shot. <br><br> My trouble was that I&#x2019;d had little practice failing. I came up during a very specific era of child-rearing in which everyone seemed to be�lieve that if Little Sally ever failed at anything, ever, she was going to be completely wrecked for life. Dutifully they set about sanding off the sharp edges of existence and childproofing all possible sce�narios against hazards of choking under pressure. Trophies for everyone! A part for everyone in the school play. No failure. No re�jection. You are a golden snowflake. Have a sticker. <br><br> For someone who hoped to make a career of rejection, this was a considerable setback. <br><br> I had no opportunity to pursue failure in high school either, where, distressingly, I kept succeeding at things. By senior year, I had been appointed president of four clubs and had mysteriously be�come captain of the volleyball team, even though I never left the bench. As a flop, I was a failure. <br><br> College was a different story. With a clean slate and thousands of people who didn&#x2019;t know that I was doing it on purpose, I could be�gin my training for the big bomb. <br> I began collecting rejections. <br><br> There was an art, I quickly learned, to flopping. You couldn&#x2019;t just be bad. Half the art is knowing how to go too far. You must keep a straight face. If you&#x2019;re auditioning, you must sing badly, but feelingly. You must put the emphasis on the wrong syllable, read comedy as tragedy and tragedy as comedy. Overact, overgesture, pause for no reason midsentence and open and close your mouth like a bewil�dered carp. You must, in a word, turn in a whole performance. <br><br> I began my training in my freshman year, auditioning for plays under a false name. You could be more convincingly terrible, I dis�covered, when you had a backstory, so I crafted a character. Her name was Gloria Nichols. She had recently lost a lot of weight, loved to make bold gestures where no bold gestures were called for, and was polite to excess, striving to please an unseen vocal teacher who told her she had great promise. <br><br> &#x201c;Any talents?&#x201d; the student directors asked. <br><br> &#x201c;I have heart!&#x201d; I wrote. &#x201c;And kidneys!&#x201d; <br><br> Gradually, I broadened my scope. I auditioned for the Women in Science Players Ensemble. It was the first audition I&#x2019;d seen listed that was on campus but involved no one I could conceivably ever have met. For my monologue, I recited Yoda&#x2019;s death scene from <i>Return of the Jedi </i>in its entirety, doing all the voices. It was a natural choice; as a <i>Star Wars </i>fan, I already had the dialogue memorized. <br><br> &#x201c;Lu-uke,&#x201d; I croaked. &#x201c;There is another s-ky-wa-kk-errr.&#x201d; <br><br> When it was over, they looked at me. They seemed to be decid�ing whether to be angry or confused. <br><br> &#x201c;What possessed you to choose this as your monologue?&#x201d; they asked. <br><br> &#x201c;<i>Star Wars </i>is science,&#x201d; I said. <br><br> It was a start. <br><br> Later that fall, when I saw a Craigslist ad for Halloween Dancers, I knew it was directed at me . . . even though my dance experience was restricted to the five miserable years of ballet that gets foisted on every girl of a certain demographic too timid to play soccer. <br><br> To give you an idea of how good I was at ballet, when we per�formed <i>The Nutcracker</i>, I played the Girl with the Butterfly Net. There is no such character in <i>The Nutcracker</i>. After each scene of the real ballet was finished, I ran across the stage holding a butter�fly net. <br><br> The Craigslist ad was for &#x201c;Pussycat Doll&#x2013;Style Dancers.&#x201d; As far as I could tell, it did not require prior experience, and it paid. <br><br> The audition was all the way out in Quincy, Massachusetts. I took the subway there from Cambridge, since I somehow had the naive idea that everything in Quincy was located conveniently on top of the T stop. This turned out not to be the case. Having decided to look the part, I found myself walking along Massachusetts State Highway 3A in leopard-print leggings and a tank top. Cars kept slowing. I waved them on. <br><br> The ad listed the audition location as My House, which I assumed was a bar because of the capital letters. But bars usually don&#x2019;t have doorbells. <br><br> Another thing I realized when I finally arrived was that I had forgotten to choreograph the requested five minutes of dance. The only song on my iPod of more than four minutes was &#x201c;Will You Be There&#x201d; by Michael Jackson. That would have to do. <br><br> Despite the doorbell, My House was, in fact, a bar. (I can tell you this definitely only because I Googled it later, but there were some clues on arriving.) The overall aesthetic inside was sort of like a gen�trified barn, whose previous cow occupants had all been forced to become leather couches or leave. Everything was dark wood. The main room gave off a vaguely baffled vibe, like it didn&#x2019;t quite know whether the party theme was Hip Happening Club Scene Place, Man Cave With Leather Chairs, or Old- timey Stage Set and was trying to split the difference. <br><br> On getting inside, I discovered a large stage area cleared away. There were a few unenthusiastic colored spotlights on the ceiling that seemed to have been laid off from a job at a strip club to which their talents had been much better suited. Near the dance floor, at a table, sat two judges, a black man and woman who looked to be in their mid-thirties, both of whom seemed friendly and encouraging. <br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here for the dance audition,&#x201d; I told them. They gave me a still-friendly but mildly perplexed look, the kind of look I assume you would give someone if you crawled out of the desert starving on hands and knees and that person handed you a jar of pickles. It was the kind of look you get when someone unwraps your gift, and there&#x2019;s a longish pause, and then the recipient starts to tell you that it was a Really Lovely Thought. <br><br> &#x201c;I brought my own music,&#x201d; I added. <br><br> Five minutes is a much longer time than you think it is. Having run through my entire repertoire of dance moves in the first min�ute, growing from a seed into a tree and then back, Flowers-for-Algernon- Style, I decided that I would repeat each movement eight times while turning slowly counterclockwise. <br><br> This was when the male judge burst into smothered laughter and darted from the room. <br><br> When the music finished, the remaining judge suggested I try something &#x201c;more upbeat.&#x201d; I gyrated futilely to Justin Timberlake while she made notes. On my way out (&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call us. We&#x2019;ll call.&#x201d;), I leaned over her notebook and glimpsed the phrase &#x201c;Good enthusiasm.&#x201d; <br><br> They didn&#x2019;t call. <br><br> But that was perfect. I had flopped, big time, with earnestness and a straight face! <br><br> I was ready to move on to bigger pastures. <br><br> That summer, I signed up to audition for <i>America&#x2019;s Next Top Model</i>. <br><br> It has always been my unwavering conviction that I would make a great After model. I&#x2019;m okay looking, but if someone told you I had just lost sixty pounds, I would look <i>incredible</i>. This, I figured, would be my &#x201c;in.&#x201d; <br><br> In order to appear on <i>America&#x2019;s Next Top Model</i>, you have to fill out a thirteen-page form detailing such things as &#x201c;Have you ever been so angry you threw something?&#x201d; (&#x201c;My back out, one time,&#x201d; I ventured.) &#x201c;What would bother you most about living in a house with nine to thirteen other people?&#x201d; (&#x201c;Not knowing more specifi�cally the number of people in the house.&#x201d;) &#x201c;What in the past do you regret?&#x201d; (&#x201c;The Holocaust.&#x201d;) <br><br> The audition itself was brief, but the afternoon entailed a <i>lot </i>of waiting around in heels. I befriended one fellow auditioner who had also failed to print out her demo shots in time, and we commiserated at the Rite Aid as we tried to coax the digital printer into submission. I had had some friends take shots of me posing in what I hoped was a model-like fashion the night before, but when I tried to print them out on my parents&#x2019; printer, it did that thing that printers do where they insist that they Absolutely Physically Cannot Print Unless All The Colors Have Been Loaded, Because Black Just Doesn&#x2019;t Feel It Would Be Right To Take This Big Step Without Cyan Present. <br><br> It was unnerving to be waiting for my prints to come next to someone who actually wanted it. She kept talking about her strat�egy for winning, pointing out the flaws and weaknesses of the other girls in line. I couldn&#x2019;t see any flaws or weaknesses, other than maybe that they were too skinny and attractive and might blow over in a high wind. I couldn&#x2019;t tell her I was there to lose. Instead, I stood there smiling amiably and murmuring that everyone &#x201c;looked like a model,&#x201d; which seemed safe. <br><br> When you got in front of the judges you had to walk your model walk, which, since I was in heels, was difficult. In heels, I always look like something that is walking on land for the first time&#x2014;less Ariel than some kind of recently evolved amphibian. I teetered boldly from one end of the designated Walk space to the other, try�ing to be Fierce like Tyra said. I handed them my photos. <br><br> They asked us to tell a video camera the craziest thing we&#x2019;d ever done to win a contest. I told them about the time I had crashed a dog show and run the agility course myself. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t really about winning the contest,&#x201d; I admitted, &#x201c;but it certainly seemed to un�nerve the other dogs.&#x201d; (This had occurred in Bermuda and had, I realized, been good practice for making an idiot of myself. As a general note, if you ever want to run a dog agility course, just tell the organizer that you need to do it in honor of your deceased dog, &#x201c;Topanga.&#x201d; This is what I did, and to my total surprise, they cleared the dogs off the course and let me run it. It may have helped that I was wearing a helmet at the time. I had recently gotten off a mo�ped, but the organizer had no way of knowing that and it probably looked to her as though something ominous was the matter with me. P. S. Dog agility courses are hard, especially if you are not en�tirely sober.) <br><br> They seemed pleased by the story, but months passed, and I heard only silence. They get in touch with you only if you make the show. Otherwise, you just find yourself on...</p><h2>The Book of Think: Or How to Solve a Problem Twice Your Size (Brown Paper School Book)</h2><p>Brain-teasers, riddles, and projects help the young reader discover new ways of thinking about problems of logic and communication</p><p></p><h2>The Silence of God (Sir Robert Anderson Library)</h2><p>The author gives a thoroughly scriptural answer to the issue of God&#39;s silence for nearly two thousand years.</p><p>Sir Robert Anderson (1841-1918) was converted to Christ at the age of nineteen and almost immediately began to preach in his native Dublin where he trained for a legal profession at Trinity College.

Personal freedom means having the freedom to be able to control your thoughts and to manifest the kinds of feelings you want in your life.<br><br>We are often imprisoned by the chains of our thoughts and we allow ourselves to think ourselves into problems. However, since most problems are created by our imagination and are thus imaginary, all we need are imaginary solutions. So, here are some effective ways of controlling your thinking for a change.<br><br>Think of a time when you felt really good. Now, step inside that time and see through your eyes, hear through your ears, and feel the really good feeling all the way through your body. Make the images bigger, brighter, more colorful, and you'll probably find yourself feeling even better. Make the sounds louder and crisper, and if there are no sounds, add sounds. Start to intensify the good feeling.<br><br>Next, find out where in your body the feeling starts and where it goes. Discover the direction it spins inside your body, and spin it faster and faster and, again, notice your feelings intensify. There lies the control you have over your brain to create powerful feelings inside of you.<br><br>You can then attach these feelings to other thoughts. If you keep spinning this feeling inside your body and you think about your future while it's spinning, you will start to associate the feeling with your future. By doing this, you will start to feel better about your future.<br><br></p> <p><strong>How to Feel Wonderful Exercise</strong></p> <p><br>1 - Think of a time you felt wonderful.<br>2 - Close your eyes and imagine that time in vivid detail. See the image clearly, hear the sounds loudly, remember the feelings as they were then.<br>3 - Imagine yourself stepping into that experience and imagine being in that memory as if it's happening now. See what you'd see, hear what you'd hear, feel how good you'd feel. Make the colors stronger and brighter if that helps. Notice how you were breathing back then, and breathe that way now.<br>4 - Pay attention to the wonderful feeling in your body and get a sense of where the feeling starts, where it goes, and the direction it moves in. Imagine taking control over the feeling and spinning it faster and faster and stronger and stronger through your body as the feelings increase.<br>5 - Think of a time in the future where you could use these good feelings. Spin these feelings throughout your body as you think about the future and the things you are doing over the next few weeks. Don't be too surprised if you find yourself feeling really good for absolutely no reason.</p> <p>Similarly too, if you find yourself in a negative or unresourceful state, you can change your mood by changing the qualities of the feeling.<br><br>For example, think about somebody who annoys you, intimidates you, or irritates you. Make an image of him and see him look at you in whatever way he looks at you when he is annoying you. Hear him say whatever it is he says and notice the bad feeling that happens in your body.<br><br>Next, take this image and make it black and white. Move it far off into the distance. Make it much smaller, one-eighth its size. Place a clown's nose on his face. Hear him say whatever it is he says, but hear him say it in Mickey Mouse's, Donald Duck's, or Sylvester the Cat's voice. This changes the feeling you have toward him and allows you to deal with him with more confidence and effectiveness.<br><br></p> <p><strong>Changing Bad Feelings Exercise</strong></p> <p><br>1 - Think about somebody who annoys you, intimidates you, or irritates you.

Extraordinary for its elegance of style and complete immersion in Shelley&#x2019;s work, <i>Being Shelley</i> aims to turn the poet&#x2019;s life inside out: rather than tracing the events of a life in which poetry erupts occasionally, it tracks the inner journey of a spirit struggling to escape and create.<br><br>In her own quest to understand Shelley, Ann Wroe takes up the questions that consume the poet himself: Who, or what, was he? What was his purpose? Where had he come from? And where was he going? By answering those questions, Shelley sought to free and empower not only himself, but the entire human race. His revolution would shatter the Earth&#x2019;s illusions, shock men and women with new visions, find true love and liberty--and take everyone with him.<br><br>Now, for the first time, this passionate and radical quest is put at the center of Shelley&#x2019;s life. The result is a Shelley who has never been seen in biography before.</p><p>Ann Wroe is a senior editor at <i>The Economist</i> and the author of <i>Pontius Pilate, </i>which was a finalist for the Samuel Johnson Prize. She is also the author of <i>A Fool and His Money </i>and <i>The Perfect Prince</i>. She lives in London.<b>Chapter 1: Substance </b><br><br>In later life, Charles MacFarlane recalled the moment more or less exactly. He was standing in the Royal Bourbon Museum in Naples in February 1819, admiring a statue assumed to be of Agrippina, when someone at his shoulder murmured words. The remark had something to do with the statue&#x2019;s gracefulness, little enough in itself, though it seemed &#x2018;that sort of commonplace which is not heard from the vulgar&#x2019;. MacFarlane remembered rather the voice, soft and strangely touching. The speaker was a gentleman of twenty-five or twenty-six, English, thin, with a delicate and negligent, even wild, appearance. They had not been introduced. <br>&nbsp;<br>Falling in together, they wandered from statue to statue for the rest of the afternoon. His new escort talked avidly of Beauty, Justice, the Venus di Medici (&#x2018;all over a goddess!&#x2019;), love of the Ideal and the astonishments of modern archaeology. At the end he shook MacFarlane&#x2019;s hand, thanked him heartily, and disappeared. MacFarlane realised that he still had no idea who his &#x2018;unknown friend&#x2019; had been. No name had been proffered, no visiting card. Instead he was left with fragments of deep thought, like leaves from a private notebook. <br>&nbsp;<br>His mysterious companion had a past. You could learn from his acquaintances that he was Percy Bysshe Shelley, born at Field Place, Horsham, Sussex, in 1792, the first son of Timothy Shelley, landowner, sometime MP for New Shoreham and, since 1815, a baronet.The family was large: Shelley had four younger sisters and a brother 14 years his junior. He had been schooled at Syon House Academy and Eton, where he excelled in Latin composition; and at University College, Oxford, where after one term, in March 1811, he had been expelled with his best friend, Thomas Jefferson Hogg, for writing a pamphlet entitled <i>The Necessity of Atheism</i>. He had eloped the next August, aged nineteen, with a schoolgirl of sixteen, Harriet Westbrook; and then, that marriage having failed, had run off in 1814 with the almost-as-young Mary Godwin, daughter of William Godwin, the philosopher, and Mary Wollstonecraft, a champion of the rights of women. With Mary and her sixteen-year-old step-half-sister, Jane (later Claire) Clairmont, he had journeyed for six weeks through France and Germany in a sort of <i>m�nage � trois</i>, and had set up a household with the girls on returning. As a result of this extraordinary behaviour his father had severed all connection with him, leaving Shelley for a time almost destitute; and despite his eventual marriage to Mary Godwin, the Lord Chancellor in 1817 had deprived him, on the double grounds of immorality and atheism, of the two infant children of his first marriage. <br>&nbsp;<br>From boyhood he had written poems, as well as political tracts and the odd romantic novel. According to taste these were tedious, blasphemous or immoral, though a few saw beauty and genius in them. For a while, fearing that he had Jacobin tendencies and meant to revolutionise England in the style seen so recently in France, the government watched him, but most of his writings proved too obscure to be subversive. Disheartened and discredited, and convinced (for he had never retracted either his atheism or his singular notions of morality) that his two children by Mary Godwin would also be taken from him, he had left England in March 1818 for Italy. And there he seemed likely to remain. <br>&nbsp;<br>MacFarlane later learned a little of this, including Shelley&#x2019;s name, from mutual friends who formally introduced them. On a subsequent day they drove out in a carriage as far as Pompeii, hurtling crazily along to the ruins and back, and visited a macaroni factory where his companion, like a schoolboy, exulted in the giant levers that pressed out the pasta and, as he left, gave his small change to beggars. Of his life, condition and history he continued to provide no details. Much of the afternoon was spent sitting by the sea on curious lava rocks, watching until sunset the tranquil waves breaking on the sand, in the sort of enforced intimacy in which English gentlemen may sometimes feel induced to talk of schooldays or love affairs. In all that time, Shelley said nothing. MacFarlane, looking at his sad, lined face, concluded that he should not break the silence. <br>&nbsp;<br>Shelley&#x2019;s past seemed hateful to him. For most of his life he looked passionately forward, taking, as his friend Hogg observed at Oxford, &#x2018;no pleasure in the retrospect&#x2019;. He read history occasionally, but out of duty rather than pleasure; his historical dramas were aberrations in his career. The &#x2018;record of crimes &amp; miseries&#x2019; that men had left on earth was testimony merely to the worst of human nature. Facts, Shelley wrote, in poetry or history or in the lives of men, &#x2018;are not what we want to know&#x2019;. Sometimes he used the word &#x2018;cered&#x2019; of memories, to imply that he had coated them, like corpses, with impermeable wax. <br>&nbsp;<br>A few stories only he told frequently and with zest. One was of stabbing a boy in the hand with a knife (sometimes a fork) at Eton, pinning him viciously to his desk on some noble and desperate impulse; another was a fight, related at the highest pitch of horror, with an intruder in Wales who had tried to murder him. Neither may have been true. &#x2018;His imagination&#x2019;, one friend recalled, &#x2018;often presented past events to him as they might have been, not as they were.&#x2019; Hogg&#x2019;s view was less poetic and more blunt: &#x2018;He was altogether incapable of rendering an account of any transaction whatsoever, according to the strict and precise truth, and the bare naked realities of actual life.&#x2019; Again, imagination was to blame. Indulgently, two of Shelley&#x2019;s sisters remembered his boyhood account of a visit to some ladies in the village, their conversation, his wanderings in their garden along a winding turf bank and a filbert walk, when he had never been there. <br>&nbsp;<br>In 1814, when they eloped and fled to France, Shelley and Mary Godwin began a joint journal. Very quickly his entries dwindled, then stopped. The few he made gave the doings of &#x2018;S.&#x2019; in the third person, at one remove from himself. In 1816, Mary tried to persuade him to write a story based on his early life; he started, but could not keep it up, any more than he could follow her desire to put more human interest in his poems. Whatever he had been since birth he endeavoured to leave behind. He could not help it that his mother had a miniature of him, sweet and bright-eyed, with three rows of buttons on his best jacket; or that his four younger sisters were full of stories of him, the adored and bullying elder brother, with his terrifying tales and his rough garden games. His friend Edward Trelawny once told him that he had met two of his sisters at an evening party. Shelley, after giving him a hard, cold stare, walked away from him and out of the room. <br>&nbsp;<br>His writings gave few more clues. Experiences of boyhood made a line here and there: shells found on the beach, a breathless run in the night woods, hard-boiled eggs and radishes stowed in his pockets, and a walk at school beside a mossy fence with a boy he thought &#x2018;exquisitely beautiful&#x2019;, their arms round each other&#x2019;s shoulders. But such memories were no sooner found than they were suppressed again. All that mattered to him of his childhood he seemed to commit to a notebook in 1820, in several strongly underlined verses of the Wisdom of Solomon in the Apocrypha: <br>&nbsp;<br><i>I myself also am a mortal man, like to all, &amp; the offspring of him that was first made of the Earth. </i><br>&nbsp;<br><i>And in my mothers womb was fashioned to be flesh in the time of ten months, being compacted in blood, of the seed of man and the pleasure that came with sleep. </i><br>&nbsp;<br><i>And when I was born I drew in the common air, &amp; fell upon the earth which is of like nature, &amp; the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do </i><br>&nbsp;<br><i>I was nursed in swaddling clothes &amp; that with cares. </i><br>&nbsp;<br><i>For there is no King that had any other beginning of birth. </i><br>&nbsp;<br>*** <br>&nbsp;<br>His own beginning was as a Sussex boy. He had been pushed into existence in a first-floor bedroom at Field Place near Horsham, a red-brick Tudor house with Georgian attachments nestled in a snug dip of copses and lawns. There was no view, save of near slopes or outbuildings; his child&#x2019;s world was circumscribed and close as a womb. A Sussex nurse with a flat, burring accent rocked him in her arms. He was embraced by Established Anglicanism in the nearby church at Warnham,crouched among yews and tombs. His ancestors lay there under slabs of black stone engraved with three whelk shells, the family arms, or were commemorated on marble plaques in the small, drab Shelley chapel, where those of his family who cared to could say their prayers. <br>&nbsp;<br>Until the age of ten he was schooled in Warnham vicarage, a country education, though reams of Latin verses rang already in his head. He could put on rustic clothes and act the yokel for fun, toting a truss of hay on his shoulder and riding in farmers&#x2019; carts. Around him and into St Leonard&#x2019;s Forest stretched Shelley fields, farms and stands of timber that would one day be his. <br>&nbsp;<br>Here and there in his poems he placed Sussex touches: shadows outracing the wind on the long grass slopes of the Downs, a dog herding sheep to the corner of a field, spiders&#x2019; webs in hayrick and hedge, bats beating against the wired window of a dairy. Grey moths fluttered out of heaps of new-mown, still-moving grass; over the woods, a flock of rooks rose at the crack of a farmer&#x2019;s gun. Small clouds in the sky were &#x2018;crudded&#x2019;, like a dish of curds, or scattered out quietly like sheep grazing. Several poems carried memories of water and flowers observed at Warnham pond through a grille of reeds, branches and his own small fingers locked aga...</p><h2>A Blink of the Screen: Collected Shorter Fiction</h2><p>A collection of short fiction from Terry Pratchett, spanning the whole of his writing career from schooldays to Discworld and the present day.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>In the four decades since his first book appeared in print, Terry Pratchett has become one of the world's best-selling and best-loved authors.

Mind you, so was I, being thirteen at the time. It&#x2019;s the first thing I ever wrote that got published. In fact it&#x2019;s the first thing I ever wrote with the feeling that I was writing a real story.</i><br><br><i>It began as a piece of homework. The �En�glish teacher gave me twenty marks out of twenty for it, and put it in the school magazine. The kids liked it. I was a writer.</i><br><br><i>And this was a big deal, because I �hadn&#x2019;t �really been anything up until then. I was good at �En�glish. At everything else I was middling, one of those kids that don&#x2019;t catch the teacher&#x2019;s eye and are very glad of it. I was even bad at sports, except for the one wonderful term when they let us play hockey, when I was bad and very dangerous.</i><br><br><i>But the other kids had liked it. I&#x2019;d sniffed blood.</i><br><br><i>There were three, yes, three professional sf and fantasy magazines published in the UK in those days. Unbelievable, but true.

You now have a rough idea as to what Crucible&#x2019;s front hall resembled.<br><br>The smoke was coming from under the study door. Dimly remembering a film he had once seen, Crucible clapped a hand�kerchief to his nose and staggered to the kitchen. One bucket of water later, he returned. The door would not budge. The phone was in the study, so as to be handy in an emergency. Putting down the pail, Crucible applied his shoulder to the door, which remained closed. He retreated to the opposite wall of the hall, his eyes streaming. Gritting his teeth, he charged.<br><br>The door opened of its own accord. Crucible described a graceful arc across the room, ending in the fireplace, then everything went black, literally and figuratively, and he knew no more.<br>A herd of elephants were doing the square dance, in clogs, on Crucible&#x2019;s head. He could see a hazy figure kneeling over him.<br><br>&#x201c;Here, drink this.&#x201d;<br><br>Ah, �health-�giving �joy-�juice! Ah, invigorating �stagger-�soup! Those elephants, having changed into slippers, were now dancing a sedate waltz: the whiskey was having the desired effect.

He rose to his feet, brushing the soot from his clothes.<br><br>&#x201c;Shall we be going?&#x201d; he asked mournfully.<br><br>&#x201c;Going? Where to?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Other Place, I suppose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Other �Pl&#x2014;�? Oh, you mean home! Good �Heav&#x2014;� oops! �pardon �me&#x2014;�Hell! no!

You&#x2019;ve spilt your drink all over the carpet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;W-�why me?&#x201d; croaked Crucible.<br><br>&#x201c;You are the owner of the Square Deal Advertising Company, are you not? We want you to make the public conscious, �Hell-�wise. Not for eternal damnation, of course. Just day trips, etcetera, Grand Tour of Hell, and all that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And if I refuse?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What would you say to ten thousand pounds?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good-bye.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Twenty thousand?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm.

Besides&#x201d;&#x2014;the Devil pressed the tips of his fingers together and smiled at the ceiling&#x2014;&#x201c;there are some rather incriminating facts about the �Payne-�Smith Products case, which we could make public?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re speaking my language. Forty thousand pounds and hush about the P and S case?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Done.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you see it my way,&#x201d; said the Devil. Crucible seated himself behind his mahogany desk and took out a pad. He indicated a polished silver box.<br><br>&#x201c;Cigarette?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;<br><br>Crucible took a cigarette himself and felt for his lighter. Suddenly, a thought struck him.<br><br>&#x201c;How do I know you are Old Nick?&#x201d;<br><br>The Devil shuddered. &#x201c;Please! Nicholas Lucifer to you. Well, I know about the P and S case, don&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br><br>Crucible&#x2019;s eyes gleamed.<br><br>&#x201c;You may be some �smart-�aleck Dick. Convince me. Go on, �convince me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, you asked for it. By the way, that gun in your �left-�hand pocket would be useless against me.&#x201d; The Devil leaned nonchalantly, extending a finger �towards Crucible.<br><br>&#x201c;See? You&#x2019;re a phoney, a low �do&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>Crack!<br><br>A bolt of lightning shot across the room. The end of Crucible&#x2019;s cigarette glowed.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2014;�I&#x2014;�I&#x2019;m convinced!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So glad.&#x201d;<br><br>Crucible became his old self.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get down to business. I take it you want Hell to be exploited in every possible way?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m afraid I can&#x2019;t do much until I have seen the �place&#x2014;�from the living point of view, you understand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quite. Well, I could take you back with me, but that might be a �hair-�raising experience for you. Tell you what, if you wait at the �corner of this street, �at&#x2014;�shall we say, eight o&#x2019;clock this �evening?&#x2014;�I could pick you up and we could walk there. Okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be seeing you, then. Cheerio!&#x201d;<br><br>Poomf!<br><br>He was gone. The room was again filled with sulphurous smoke. Crucible opened the windows and then closed them again. If some busybody saw the smoke, he would have a hard time explaining to the Fire Brigade just why there was no fire. He strolled into the kitchen and sat down thoughtfully; he wished he had read more fantasy.<br><br>In wishing the Devil would mind his own business, Crucible was thinking along the same lines as certain other beings. Where they differed was the reason. Crucible opened the fridge and took out a can of beer.<br><br>Having someone running around loose, who knows about things one would prefer to keep to oneself, is dangerous. Crucible&#x2019;s love of money warred with his love of freedom. He wanted that forty �thousand pounds, but he did not want Lucifer running around loose.<br><br>Suddenly, the perfect solution struck him. Of course! Why not! He grabbed his hat, and hurried out to the local church.<br>Crucible stood in the pouring rain at the corner of the street. A small stream of water was coursing down his back and flooding his suedes. He looked at his watch. One minute to eight o&#x2019;clock. He shivered.<br><br>&#x201c;Psst!&#x201d;<br><br>Crucible looked round.<br><br>&#x201c;Down here.&#x201d;<br><br>He saw that a �manhole in the middle of the pavement was raised. The Devil poked his head out.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Through there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>He edged himself through the narrow hole.<br><br>Splash!<br><br>He would have to put his shoes on &#x201c;Expenses.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s be off,&#x201d; said the Devil.<br><br>&#x201c;I �didn&#x2019;t know one could get to Down There along the sewers!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Easiest thing there is, old man. Left here.&#x201d;<br><br>There was no sound but the echoes of their footsteps: Crucible&#x2019;s suedes and the Devil&#x2019;s hooves.<br>&#x201c;How much further?&#x201d;<br><br>They had been walking for several hours. Crucible&#x2019;s feet were damp and he was sneezing.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re there, old man.&#x201d;<br><br>They had come to the end of the tunnel. Before them stretched a dark valley. In the distance, Crucible could see a giant wall, with a tiny door. Across the valley ran a black river; the air was tainted with sulphur.<br><br>The Devil removed a tarpaulin from a hump by the tunnel mouth.<br><br>&#x201c;May I present Geryon II!&#x201d;<br><br>Crucible blinked. Geryon II was a �Model T Ford crossed with an Austin 7, tastefully decorated in sulphurous yellow.<br><br>The Devil wrenched at the offside door, which fell off.<br><br>They climbed in. Surprisingly, the car started after only a few swings of the starting handle.<br><br>They chugged across the sulphur plain.<br><br>&#x201c;Nice car.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it! Forty �dragon-�power. Built her myself from a few bits and pieces from Earth. Trouble with springing out of the floor near a �junkyard,&#x201d; said the Devil, gritting his fangs as they cornered at speed in a cloud of sulphur, &#x201c;is the fact one often surfaces under a pile of old iron.&#x201d; He rubbed his head. Crucible noticed that one of his horns was bandaged.<br><br>They skidded to a halt by the river. The car emitted clouds of steam.<br><br>A battered punt was moored by the river. The Devil helped Crucible in and picked up the �skulls&#x2014;�pardon �me&#x2014;�sculls.<br><br>&#x201c;What happened to �what&#x2019;s his name&#x2014;�Charon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t like to talk about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;<br><br>Silence, except for the creaking of the oars.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, you&#x2019;ll have to replace this by a bridge.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes.&#x201d;<br><br>Crucible looked thoughtful.<br><br>&#x201c;A ha&#x2019;penny for them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am thinking,&#x201d; said Crucible, &#x201c;about the water that is lapping about my ankles.&#x201d;<br><br>The Devil did not look up.<br><br>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d;<br><br>He handed Crucible a battered mug, on which the initials &#x201c;B. R.&#x201d; were just discernible. And so they continued.<br><br>They stood in front of the gate. Crucible looked up and read the inscription:<br><br>ALL HOPE ABANDON, YE WHO ENTER HERE.<br><br>&#x201c;No good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Neon lights.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Red ones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Flashing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes?&#x201d;<br><br>They entered.<br><br>&#x201c;Down, boy; get off Crucible.&#x201d;<br><br>Three tongues licked Crucible simultaneously.<br><br>&#x201c;Back to your kennel, boy.&#x201d;<br><br>Whining, Cerberus slunk off.<br><br>&#x201c;You must excuse him,&#x201d; said the Devil, as he picked Crucible up and dusted him down. &#x201c;He has never been the same since he took a lump out of Orpheus&#x2019;s leg.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It �didn&#x2019;t say that in the story.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know. Pity, because the real story was much �more&#x2014;�er, interesting. But �that&#x2019;s neither here nor there.&#x201d;<br>Crucible took stock of his surroundings. They appeared to be standing in a hotel lobby. In one wall was a small alcove containing a desk, on which a huge Residents&#x2019; book, covered in dust, lay open.<br><br>The Devil opened a small wooden door.<br><br>&#x201c;This way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My office.&#x201d;<br><br>Crucible followed him up the narrow stairway, the boards creaking under his feet.<br><br>The Devil&#x2019;s office, perched precariously on the walls of Hell, was rather dilapidated. There was a patch of damp in one corner, where the Styx had overflowed, and the paper was peeling off the wooden walls. A rusty stove in the corner glowed red-hot. Crucible noticed that the floor seemed to be covered with old newspapers, bills, and recipes for various spells.<br><br>The Devil dropped into a commodious armchair while Crucible sat down in a tortuous cane chair, which all but collapsed under his weight.<br><br>&#x201c;Drink?&#x201d; said the Devil.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind if I do,&#x201d; said Crucible.<br><br>&#x201c;Very nice drink, this,&#x201d; said Crucible. &#x201c;Your own recipe?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Quite �simple&#x2014;�two pints bats&#x2019; blood, �one&#x2014;� I say! You&#x2019;ve gone a funny colour! Feel all right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ulp! Ghack! �Um&#x2014;�quite all right, thanks. �Er&#x2014;�shall we get down to business?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, as I see it, our main difficulty will be to make the public take �Hell&#x2014;�and you for that �matter&#x2014;�seriously. I mean, the generally �accepted theory of Hell is a sort of fiery furnace, with you prodding lost souls with a pitchfork and hordes of demons and �whatnot running around �yelling&#x2014;� Hey, that reminds me, where is �everybody&#x2014;�er, soul?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lost souls and demons and banshees and �whatnot?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, them. Well, like I said, no one has been down here for two thousand years, except that nit, Dante. And all the souls down here gradually worked their way up to Purgatory, and thence �to&#x2014;�yes, well, the demons all got jobs elsewhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tax collectors,&#x201d; murmured Crucible.<br><br>&#x201c;Quite so. As for fiery furnaces, the only one still in working order is the Mark IV, over there in the corner. Very useful for my culinary efforts but not for much else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hm. I see. Have you a map of Hell handy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think so.&#x201d; The Devil rummaged in an old oak desk behind him and produced a roll of yellow parchment.<br><br>&#x201c;This is the newest map I have.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll do. Now let me see. Hum. I take it this is where we came in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes! That shading is the Sulphur Plain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good. I&#x2019;m sure the Acme Mining Company would give a lot to have the mining rights&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, we would have to build a proper road over it for the increased transport&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get a large tunnel dug down from Earth&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Coffee bar here. Dance hall there. Racetrack at the far end. Bowling alley over&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We could put a �funfair here&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Leaving room for a restaurant there&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Put some �ice cream stalls here and here, and here&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All-�night jazz band there. Get in touch with your demons and offer them higher wages to come back to help run the place&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get Orpheus to organize a jazz band&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sure Apollo would oblige&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>And so it continued. Soon the map was covered in symbols representing everything from a dance hall to a cycle track. Then they sat back and discussed Stage One: putting Hell in the public eye.</p><h2>Riches Among the Ruins: Adventures in the Dark Corners of the Global Economy</h2><p>Today, Robert P.

Smith, a young, brash economic mercenary, traveled to war-torn El Salvador looking to make money trad�ing dollar-denominated government bonds. As an American, he had to remain innocuous and virtually invisible while traveling the danger�ous streets of San Salvador. Then one morn�ing, he was shaken out of bed by an explosion at the Sheraton Hotel, just blocks from where he was staying. Not only did he escape with his life, he had just managed to make a killing&#x2014;within a matter of days, he was able to buy and sell $3 million of these bonds at an impressive mark-up. But there was a catch. Smith&#x2019;s buyer would only pay in colones, the local currency. To realize his profit, Smith would then have to enter the shad�owy word of the cambista, or money changer. </p> <p> </p> <p> Today, Smith is a certified legend in the world of finance.

Throughout his career, he has made and lost tens of millions of dollars by investing in economies wracked by war, revolution, and cor�ruption. Today, the trade in emerging mar�ket debt is worth more than five billion dollars a day, but it was virtually nonexistent when Smith&#x2014;a one-time collections lawyer in a rumpled, cheap seersucker suit, bow-tie, and bad toupee&#x2014;pioneered the business in the late 1970s. </p> <p> </p> <p> <i>Riches Among the Ruins</i> is the extraordinary story of Robert Smith&#x2019;s ability to utilize his impec�cable instincts and incredible knowl��edge of the global economy to make big money doing the riskiest kind of business.

He wrote countless stories and thirty-three plays, in some of which he performed. Several films have been made from his novels, including The Sound of Waves, Enjo which was based on The Temple of the Golden Pavilion and The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea. Among his other works are the novels Confessions of a Mask and Thirst for Love and the short story collections Death in Midsummer and Acts of Worship. The Sea of Fertility tetralogy, however, is his masterpiece. After Mishima conceived the idea of The Sea of Fertility in 1964, he frequently said he would die when it was completed. On 25 November 1970, the day he completed The Decay of the Angel, the last novel of the cycle, Mishima committed seppuku (ritual suicide) at the age of forty-five.

In the same way that Susan Brownmiller&#x2019;s <i>Against Our Will</i> transformed our understanding of rape by moving the stigma from the victim to the perpetrator, Schulman&#x2019;s <i>Ties That Bind</i> calls on us to recognize familial homophobia. She invites us to understand it not as a personal problem but a widespread cultural crisis. She challenges us to take up our responsibilities to intervene without violating families, community, and the state. With devastating examples, Schulman clarifies how abusive treatment of homosexuals at home enables abusive treatment of homosexuals in other relationships as well as in society at large.<br> <br>Ambitious, original, and deeply important, Schulman&#x2019;s book draws on her own experiences, her research, and her activism to probe this complex issue still very much with us at the start of the twenty-first century and to articulate a vision for a more accepting world.<br></p><p><b>Sarah Schulman</b> is the author of nine novels, four nonfiction books, and numerous plays.

People should read this book.<br> <i>Lambda Book Report</i> <br> <br> <i>Ties That Bind</i> is one of the most exciting gay liberation texts to appear in years...this is a rewarding, wide-ranging, and challenging work from an original mind and a talented pen, one that will make you think and help you live.<br> Doug Ireland, <i>Gay City News</i> <br> <br>Schulman boldly declares that visibility is a failed strategy for cultural change.<br> <i>Utne</i> <br> <br>[Schulman is] a writer who has played a pivotal role in the cultural and political spheres of the gay community.<br> <i>Curve</i> <br> <br>To call her book [<i>Ties That Bind</i>] pioneering would be redundant. . . . With its personal appeals, its call to arms or rather, ethics and its advice for therapists, family members, and gay people, I continue to be struck by the book&#x2019;s usefulness above all else. . . .[I]t gives me hope that one day just as Schulman stipulates homophobia could actually be a punishable crime, we could be liberated from the systematic shame and humiliation that currently defines our culture, and in that liberation necessarily granted the rights that<br>we&#x2019;ve lived without all this time.<br> <i>Velvet Park</i> <br> <br>Schulman&#x2019;s lucid dissection of the role that families play as incubators of homophobia could hardly be better.

It should blow away the hot air generated by the public debate about family values.&#x2019;<br> Andrew Ross, chair of the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis at York University<br> <br>Sarah Schulman <i>Ties That Bind</i> tackles the familial and cultural homophobia that still pervade our society.

Since then she has written and drawn some 50 volumes worth of different short stories and long-running manga series, including the fantastically popular FUSHIGI YUGI, also available in English from VIZ.

In this Sibert Medal-winning biography, James Cross Giblin penetrates this fa�ade and presents a picture of a complex person&#x2014;at once a brilliant, influential politician and a deeply disturbed man.<p></p>In a straightforward and nonsensational manner, the author explores the forces that shaped the man as well as the social conditions that furthered his rapid rise to power. Against a background of crucial historical events, Giblin traces the arc of Hitler&#x2019;s life from 1889 to 1945: his childhood, his years as a frustrated artist in Vienna, his extraordinary rise as dictator of Germany, his final days in an embattled bunker under Berlin. Powerful archival images provide a haunting visual accompaniment to this clear and compelling account of a life that left an ineradicable mark on our world. Author&#x2019;s note, bibliography, index.</p><p><p><b>James Cross Giblin</b> (1933-2016) was the author of more than twenty critically acclaimed books for young people. His book <i>The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler </i>received the Robert F. Sibert Award for Informational Books. </p>Grade 7 Up-The most complete and successful biography of the F hrer available for this audience. It takes courage to write fairly about the person who perpetuated almost certainly the most suffering and misery in the 20th century, and Giblin accepts this mantle and bears it nobly. This "extraordinary villain who promised to restore his nation's honor and dignity" began life very much as an average person. His subsequent transformation into brilliant politician and then cruel war leader and finally humiliated vanquished tyrant is presented seamlessly and realistically. The first chapter establishes the ground rules for the rest of the book as it sets out to explore how such "deadly ventures" happened. As the book continues, the historical perspective is superb. For example, while Giblin portrays Hitler's persecution of certain groups as severe and reprehensible, he also mentions the fact that during this time many nations and institutions, including American universities, had specific anti-Semitic policies. The last chapter, entitled "Hitler Lives," shows how some people to this day are attempting to perpetuate the man's legacy and beliefs. This book maintains focus on the life of its subject-including his pets and love life-and does not, as many others do, stray into areas belonging to books specifically on the Holocaust or World War II. Good-quality photos, political cartoons, and reproductions augment the text. A biography in the truest sense, this is a terrifying must for all libraries.<br><i>Andrew Medlar, Chicago Public Library, IL</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Supremes: A Saga of Motown Dreams, Success, and Betrayal</h2><p>Drawing on intimate recollections from friends, family, and Motown contemporaries, Mark Ribowsky charts the Supremes' meteoric rise and bitter disintegration. He sheds light on Diana Ross's relationship with Berry Gordy and her cutthroat rise to top billing in the group, as well as Florence Ballard's corresponding decline. He also takes us inside the studio, examining how timeless classics were conceived and recorded on the Motown assembly line,&#x201d; and considers the place of Motown in an era of cultural upheaval, when not being black enough&#x201d; became a fierce denunciation within the black music industry.<p>Deftly combining personal testimony, history, and expert analysis, Ribowsky not only tells the full, heartbreaking story of the Supremes, but shows why Gordy's revolutionary concept of blacks singing white&#x201d; was essential to the modern evolution of music.</p></p><p><b>Mark Ribowsky</b> is the acclaimed author of eight books, including <i>He's a Rebel</i>, a biography of Phil Spector.

They were the most destructive and lethal regimes in history, murdering millions. They fought the largest and costliest war in all history. Yet millions of Germans and Russians enthusiastically supported them and the values they stood for. In this first major study of the two dictatorships side-by-side Richard Overy sets out to answer the question: How was dictatorship possible? How did they function? What was the bond that tied dictator and people so powerfully together? He paints a remarkable and vivid account of the different ways in which Stalin and Hitler rose to power, and abused and dominated their people. It is a chilling analysis of powerful ideals corrupted by the vanity of ambitious and unscrupulous men.</p><p>Richard Overy is Professor of Modern History at King&#39;s College, London. His previous books for Penguin include Russia&#39;s War and The Battle of Britain.Comparisons between Hitler and Stalin and their regimes are nothing new, but this dense, comprehensive, scholarly investigation is more nuanced than most. Overy sidesteps the simplistic debate over which dictator was more evil and focuses on how they, and the systems they created, were similar and different. He delves into their regimes thematically, in topics ranging from police states and economic systems to wartime behavior. The results yield intriguing historical insights, although the book demands a careful reading. For instance, Overy notes that both Hitler and Stalin created cults of personality, but for Hitler "personality was the defining criterion of leadership"; Stalin, on the other hand, emphasized Communist ideology first and embraced a personality cult only when he realized it could cement his stranglehold on power. Interestingly, while the Nazi Party increasingly relied on workers' support and ideology, Stalin's Communist Party&#x2014;the "vanguard of the proletariat"&#x2014;relied more and more on middle-class technocrats. At times Overy restates points long known to historians, e.g., both leaders pursued negative utopias, but from different bases: class warfare was Stalin's justification, while Hitler chose biological purity. But when he points out the differences in their policies toward minorities and nationalities&#x2014;Hitler adhered to a racial ladder, while Stalin, a Georgian, flip-flopped to suit his political goals&#x2014;Overy's analytical strength and depth of knowledge emerges. 32 pages illus.; maps. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The novel is based on the true story of a labor and delivery nurse who was prohibited from caring for a newborn because the father requested that no African-American nurses tend to his baby. In the fictional version, Ruth, the African-American nurse in question, finds herself on trial for events related to the same request made by a white supremacist father. Using the narratives of Ruth, the baby&#x2019;s father, and the female public defender who takes Ruth&#x2019;s case, Picoult examines multiple facets of racism. The topic of race in America is difficult to talk about, but in in an honest and revealing way Picoult allows readers to draw their own conclusions about how we see ourselves and others in the world. <em>Small Great Things</em> is an important and thought-provoking novel about power and prejudice that deserves to be read, digested, and shared with others. <em>--Seira Wilson, The Amazon Book Review</em>Jodi Picoult is the author of twenty-four internationally bestselling novels, including My Sister&#39;s Keeper, House Rules and The Storyteller, and has also co-written two YA books with her daughter Samantha van Leer, Between the Lines and Off the Page.

When she left them guarding the horses on the outskirts of town, they had pelted her with acorns. Morning Star was sure they would pay for it later. They always did.<br>Probably the women who stayed in the camp upriver were yammering about her. Among the Dineh, thirteen-year-old girls did not associate with boys and men. Where his little sister was concerned, Morning Star never cared what people said. That was just as well, because she had been giving them something to talk about since she took her first tottering steps out of the cradleboard. She showed no signs of changing.<br>This was the first time she had seen a Mexican fiesta. As she strode through the plaza she seemed unperturbed by the noise and unimpressed by the goods laid out around her. She wore a fringed doeskin tunic over the leather skirt whose uneven hem reached below the tops of her high moccasins. She had slung her bow and fox-skin quiver across her back. A few strings of glass beads and a small bag of <i>hodenten</i>, the sacred cattail pollen, hung around her neck.<br>She had a child's mouth, with a full upper lip that curved like a double-arced bow, but someone much older looked out from her dark eyes. She had skin the deep reddish brown of the rocky bones of the mountains where her people lived. This morning she had fidgeted while Morning Star's young wife, She Moves Like Water, had combed her knee-length hair with a bundle of stiff grass. She had twisted it into a shiny black coil and secured it at the nape of Sister's neck with the curved piece of rawhide that marked her as an unmarried maiden. She Moves Like Water had tried to give Sister advice on proper behavior, but Morning Star knew she was wasting her time.<br>"<i>Hola, amigos</i>." A trio of mounted Mexicans cantered toward the four Dineh men. One of them handed Morning Star a gourd filled with pulque, but Morning Star passed it to Cousin.<br>Morning Star and half the men would stay sober today so they could look out for the drunk ones, but he would have refused the pulque, anyway. He did not drink when Mexicans were around. As he walked through Janos, Morning Star watched the crowds of Mexicans and Dineh men mingling to drink and to gamble. He scanned the flat roofs of the low adobe buildings, looking for the barrel of a musket. When a string of firecrackers exploded, he put a hand on the haft of his knife and looked around for Sister.<br>The villagers of Janos had invited the Dineh to hold council and to receive presents, even though they believed their Apache guests quite capable of murdering them. And even when they themselves would have murdered their guests if it seemed advantageous. The Mexicans and the Dineh had warred for so long that the stories passed down about it did not have a beginning. No one believed they would have an end, either.<br>The Dineh maintained an uneasy peace with the people of Janos in order to trade dried meat, hides, and the horses, mules, and cattle they stole from the neighboring state of Sonora. In exchange the Mexicans gave them knives, beads, blankets, and corn. The sorcery of alcohol, though, could change friendship to emnity with the flight of an insult or the flash of a knife blade.<br>Morning Star was relieved when they passed the last thatched hut on the outskirts of the village. On the open stretch of desert beyond, the horses milled in the corral of mesquite branches woven between uprights.<br>"<i>Cimarrones</i>," Sister murmured. Wild ones.<br>The mustangs were wild, all right, and the Mexicans and the Dineh flapped blankets at them and poked them with poles to make them wilder. Morning Star saw no fear in his sister's eyes, and he didn't expect to. Oblivious of the noise around her, she stood at the fence and assessed the horses.<br>"That one." She pointed her nose at a chunky pony the color of dried blood. He had a long neck, a large head, and crafty eyes. His delicate ears pricked forward, as though he were analyzing the situation. His wide nostrils indicated good wind.<br>Morning Star went to talk to the jefe, the Mexican in charge, a short man wearing straw sandals and a clean white cotton shirt and trousers. He carried a stout oak club and a coil of rope into the corral.<br>He shook out a loop in his rope as he stood in the eye of that storm of hooves, teeth, and tempers. With a flick of his wrist he threw the loop over the ears of Sister's selection and pulled it tight. Men ran to help him haul the horse out of the corral. They looked like a stew at a full boil, surging this way and that while the pony bucked and thrashed. Finally they secured his legs, slipped a rope over his lower jaw, and buckled a wide strap, a surcingle, around his middle. They snubbed him, trembling and wild eyed, to one of the posts set in a line and went back for another horse.<br>Sister held out some sugar in the palm of her hand and murmured to him. He eyed her with suspicion.<br>"Is that the one you're going to ride?" Cousin asked Morning Star.<br>"No."<br>Dineh usually waited for others to explain themselves if and when they wanted to, but this was different. This involved wagering.<br>"Which one are you going to ride?" inquired He Who Yawns.<br>"None of them."<br>Broken Foot didn't ask any questions. He watched the horse stretch out his neck and snatch the sugar from Sister's palm. He watched her take pollen from the bag around her neck and make a cross with it on his forehead. He saw her blow into the pony's nostrils; then he limped off to place a wager on him.<br>"Your sister will ride for you?" Cousin obviously thought Morning Star had turned foolish.<br>"Yes." Morning Star went off to place his own bet.<br>The heaps of wagered objects grew higher. The Dineh shed their necklaces, their silver armbands, and their <i>concho</i> belts. They threw down saddles, bridles, and blankets and everything else of any value. They weren't only betting on the winning horse. They were wagering on which riders would still be clinging to their mounts' backs at the end of the race and who would be dead, alive, or badly hurt.<br>Roping the other ten horses took most of the afternoon and a week's worth of sweat and swearing. By the time all the animals stood tethered in a line, the jefe's pants and shirt were no longer white and Sister was running her hands along the rust-colored horse, murmuring to soothe him. She draped her arms over his back and stood on a rock so she could lie across him. He sidestepped and looked back at her with bulging eyes, but he didn't try to bolt.<br>"<i>Listos, muchachos</i>," shouted the mustache. "<i>A caballo</i>."<br>The men holding the mustangs took a firmer grip while the riders did their best to climb aboard. Sister hiked her skirt up under her belt. She took a running start and jumped. She scrambled into a sitting position, picked up the rope that would serve as a rein, clamped her legs against his sides, and waited. A shudder passed along his spine. Sister understood why. She must have felt like a young cougar landing on his back. He roached his back, gathered his feet like the stems in a handful of wildflowers, and awaited developments.<br>The trumpet blasted. There was a moment of stillness while the mustangs devised their strategies. The horse next to Sister promptly laid down and rolled over. The rest took off bucking and twisting, scattering onlookers or running over them.<br>Sister's pony and two others ran for the tall pole at the finish as though a pack of wolves snapped at their heels. Sister pulled ahead and was about to stand up on his back to show off when a shot rang out. The pony stumbled. His nose hit the ground, and his momentum carried his hindquarters up and over his head and Sister's. Sister somersaulted, landed on her feet, and ran a few steps to regain her balance.<br>The pony's hooves jerked, and his eyeballs rolled up. Sister squatted and ran her fingers over his chest until she found the bullet hole. None of the Dineh here possessed one of the fire sticks that spat balls of black metal. A Mexican had done this.<br>"Someone must have bet on one of the other two horses," Morning Star said.<br>Sister was outraged. "I would have won."<br>"Don't let them see that they've angered you. That gives them power over you. You can't change what's past, but you can learn from it. What have you learned today?"<br>"That I cannot trust Mexicans."<br>"You can never trust Mexicans."<br>* * *<br>Sister glared at Na'tanh, Corn Flower, sprawled on his stom-ach in a curdled puddle of half-digested beans and bad booze. If she put the chile powder into his breechclout now, he probably wouldn't even notice it. He looked dead, but he snored like a bear. He had made himself stupid with pulque, a brew that smelled worse than old moccasins.<br>She kicked the sole of his very old moccasin with the pointed toe of her own, but he only grunted. She bounced a stone off his bare buttock, taut as a drumhead. That made her feel better, but he seemed none the worse for it.<br>Whooping and weaving in their saddles, the drunken ones had left Janos the night before surrounded by those who had stayed sober. Morning Star had pulled her up to ride in front of him, and she had slept with her cheek resting on his war pony's mane and her arms around the horse's neck.<br>When they arrived in camp, most of the drinkers had slid from their horses and staggered off to fall asleep. Some of them had brought pulque home and shared it with their wives. Many of the sober ones decided to make up for lost time. The party had lasted until dawn.<br>Like Corn Flower, some of them hadn't made the effort to return to Janos for the second day of talks and trading. Sister's father had been one of those. When she passed his brush shelter, she heard him snoring.<br>He had never stopped mourning his wife, killed and scalped by Mexican bounty hunters when Sister was an infant. Morning Star had given horses, blankets, and saddles to this shaman and that one in the hope that they would cure his father's grief. Sister prayed every day, asking the all powerful spirit, Life Giver, to cure him.<br>Whenever women brewed a batch of <i>tiswin</i> from the sap of the mescal plant and announced a party, her father was the first to arrive and the last to leave. Sister would wait while he danced with the other revelers. Women whom she'd always known to be chaste would stagger off into the bushes with him. Sister's cheeks would burn as she listened to the laughter and the rustling from the darkness. In the pale light of many dawns she had helped her father home.<br>Sister couldn't stay sad this morning, though. The sky arched intensely blue. Butterflies floated in the palo verde trees crowding the dry streambed of the arroyo. Doves wooed in the mesquite trees. Women called softly from one family's cluster of brush-thatched shelters to another as they ground corn and mended moccasins.<br>When Sister reached a stand of mesquite trees, she laid out the rawhide loop of the tumpline. She began gathering limbs and placing them in one end of it. As she wandered farther away in search of firewood, she saw a barrel cactus on the sunny wall of the arroyo. Last fall's shiny yellow fruit grew in a whorl around its top.<br>She slid down the slope at the shallow mouth of the gully and walked downhill. The arroyo narrowed; the walls closed in overhead and sliced the bright strip of sunshine thinner. The overhanging rim threw a deep shade that cooled the air.<br>She reached up and picked one of the fruits. She squatted at the bottom of the cleft and rested her arms on her knees while she savored the tart juice and the crunch of the tiny black seeds packed inside.<br>A puff of cold wind startled her. It didn't belong here in the middle of the summer. It stirred the wisps of hair around her face. Its chill started a prickling at the nape of her neck. A roar filled her skull, a babble of voices. She stood up and raised her chin, her mouth partly open, her eyes closed.<br>She raised her arms to shoulder height, her palms cupped upward, as she had seen <i>di-yin</i>, holy men, do. She held them there and waited for the Wind Spirit to speak to her. When it did, the voice-that-wasn't-a-voice resonated in the bones of her face like the flutter of leaves in the cottonwood. She turned slowly until dread stopped her as surely as a stone cliff. She faced into the approaching evil and imagined Ghost Owl swooping toward her, come to steal her soul. Chills chased along her spine; her heart raced.<br>When the rumbling started she thought it was the Wind Spirit again, but then the ground began to tremble. Dirt fell from the arroyo's rim onto her shoulders and outstretched arms. The rumble fragmented into the beat of hooves. She opened her eyes as the first horse reached the edge of the gorge and leaped it. More followed. She saw the tensed muscles of their foam-flecked legs and the wide cinches under their taut bellies as they passed overhead. Drops of their sweat fell on her. She saw the clumsy wooden stirrups, each containing a dusty black boot.<br>Mexican soldiers. Lancers probably. She counted fifty or sixty at least. Not many warriors had remained in camp, and they were as sick as her father and Corn Flower.<br>When the last soldier had leaped the gully and the thunder of hooves receded, Sister tried to scramble up the steep side, impelled by the need to warn her brother's wife, her father, and the others. The soles of her moccasins slipped on the gravelly slope, and she slid to the bottom, sand driven to the quick under her fingernails.<br>She sat with her knees drawn up to make herself as small as possible. She twined her fingers together to keep them from shaking. Already the soldiers were shooting. They laughed and shouted. Sister heard the clatter of an iron lancehead striking rock and bouncing. She heard the screams of the women and children.<br>She fought back the fear rising in her throat. Fear was a distraction, and she had to be able to think and act. Her brother had told her that as soon as she was old enough to understand the words.<br>She could tell by the scattering of hooves and the rustle of bushes that they were chasing their prey through the undergrowth. She heard a horse approaching the arroyo, searching the thick brush for survivors. Sister crawled backward on her belly among the cactus and creosote bushes, th...</p><h2>The Secret Universe of Names: The Dynamic Interplay of Names and Destiny</h2><p>Which names are the sexiest?

But how do these images compare with the evidence revealed by the excavator's trowel? Recent archaeological research has transformed our understanding of the period. Reflecting this new generation of scholarship, Professor Barry Raftery presents the most convincing and up-to-date account yet published of Ireland in the millennium before the coming of Christianity.<br>The transition from Bronze Age to Iron Age in Ireland brought many changes, not least the proliferation of imposing hillforts. Did these have a purely defensive role, or were they built for ceremonial or commercial purposes? When did the Celtic character of early Ireland emerge? New findings indicate that the construction of the country's great royal centers, such as Tara and Emain Macha, coincides with the first appearance in Ireland of the material culture of the European Celts - so-called La Tene artifacts. The author argues that these were the portable trappings of a rising aristocratic elite, which expressed its power by building highly visible monuments.<br>Professor Raftery also discusses the significant advances that took place in travel and transport, including the creation of the largest roadway in prehistoric Europe; the elusive lives of the common people; the idiosyncratic genius of the local metalsmiths; and the complex religious beliefs exemplified by standing stones, and offerings in rivers and lakes. He presents fascinating new material about Ireland's contacts with the Roman world, and in a final chapter he reviews the whole question of whether La Tene culture spread to Ireland through invasion or peaceful diffusion.<br>Pagan Celtic Ireland is the definitive statement of what we currently know about the country's shadowy, Celtic origins. Generously illustrated throughout, it will be read avidly by everyone interested in Ireland's mysterious and long-lost past.</p><p>Barry Raftery was appointed Associate Professor in Celtic Archaeology at University College, Dublin.Deserves an honored place in every library. -- <i><i>Choice</i></i></p><h2>Soul Murder Revisited: Thoughts about Therapy, Hate, Love, and Memory</h2><p>Ten years after the publication of his highly acclaimed book Soul Murder, Dr. Leonard Shengold reflects anew on the circumstances and the consequences of willful abuse and neglect of children. With compelling examples from literature and from clinical cases, Dr. Shengold describes techniques of adaptation and denial by victims, the psychopathology of soul murder, and therapy techniques for restoring the capacity to love.</p><p>In this mixture of clinical and literary studies, psychoanalyst Shengold (Soul Murder, Fawcett, 1991) returns to the subject of destructive parenting. He is less concerned with whether abuse actually happens than with its impact when it is only, or mainly, imagined and how to treat patients in either category. Chapters on Swinburne, Proust, and Elizabeth Bishop and discussion of Oedipus, Kipling, ring symbolism, and narcissism will interest readers who enjoy applications of psychoanalysis to literature. Clinicians will find useful ideas for victims of actual or virtual abuse. But Shengold will not win many converts to his pessimistic Freudian stance?he asserts the centrality of murder as a motivational force and speaks of "the inexorability of our own and our parents' burdens of evil." He alienates the unconverted further with the assertion that those who reject Freud are not strong enough to face the painful truth. Some good ideas mired in presumption posing as science, suitable for a sophisticated psychoanalytic audience.?E. James Lieberman, George Washington Univ. Sch. of Medicine, Washington, DC<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.If the last book you read on psychology was written by Freud or Jung, you ought to check in with Shengold, one of the unsung pioneers. -- <i>Susan Salter Reynolds, Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></p><h2>The Preacher (Patrik Hedstrom, Book 2)</h2><p><p><strong>In the sequel to <em>The Ice Princess</em>, a series of sadistic murders spanning two generations remains unsolved&#x2015;and time is running out for the next victim.</strong></p> In the fishing community of Fjallbacka, life is remote, peaceful, and for some, tragically short.

She lives in Stockholm with her husband and five children.The Preacher 1<p></p> <br>The day was off to a promising start. He woke up early, before the rest of the family, put on his clothes as quietly as possible and managed to sneak out unnoticed. He took along his knight&#x2019;s helmet and wooden sword, which he swung happily as he ran the hundred yards from the house down to the mouth of the King&#x2019;s Cleft. He stopped for a moment and peered in awe into the sheer crevice through the rocky outcrop. The sides of the rock were six or seven feet apart, and it towered up over thirty feet into the sky, into which the summer sun had just begun to climb. Three huge boulders were solidly wedged in the middle of the cleft, and it was an imposing sight. The place held a magical attraction for a six-year-old. The fact that the King&#x2019;s Cleft was forbidden ground made it all the more tempting.<br> <br>The name had originated from King Oscar II&#x2019;s visit to Fj�llbacka in the late nineteenth century, but that was something he neither knew nor cared about as he slowly crept into the shadows, with his sword ready to attack. His father had told him that the scenes from Hell&#x2019;s Gap in the film Ronja R�vardotter had been filmed inside the King&#x2019;s Cleft. When he had watched the film himself, he felt a little tickle in his stomach as he saw the robber chieftain Mattis ride through. Sometimes he played highwaymen here, but today he was a knight. A knight of the Round Table, like in the big, fancy colored book that his grandmother had given him for his birthday.<br> <br>He crept over the boulders that covered the ground and made ready to attack the great fire-breathing dragon with his courage and his sword. The summer sun did not reach down into the cleft, which made it a cold, dark place. Perfect for dragons. Soon he would make the blood spurt from its throat, and after prolonged death throes it would fall dead at his feet.<br> <br>Out of the corner of his eye he saw something that caught his attention. He glimpsed a piece of red cloth behind a boulder, and curiosity got the better of him. The dragon could wait; maybe there was treasure hidden there. He jumped up on the rock and looked down the other side. For a moment he almost fell over backward, but after wobbling and flailing his arms around he regained his balance. Later, he would not admit that he was scared, but just then, at that instant, he had never been more terrified in all six years of his life. A lady was lying in wait for him. She was on her back, staring straight up at him with her eyes wide. His first instinct was to flee before she caught him playing here when he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be. Maybe she would force him to tell her where he lived and then drag him home to Mamma and Pappa. They would be so furious, and they were sure to ask, how many times have we told you that you mustn&#x2019;t go to the King&#x2019;s Cleft without a grown-up?<br> <br>But the odd thing was that the lady didn&#x2019;t move. She didn&#x2019;t have any clothes on either, and for an instant he was embarrassed that he was standing there looking at a naked lady. The red he had seen was not a piece of cloth but something wet right next to her, and he couldn&#x2019;t see her clothes anywhere. Funny, lying there naked. Especially when it was so cold.<br> <br>Then something impossible occurred to him. What if the lady was dead? He couldn&#x2019;t work out any other explanation for why she was lying so still. The realization made him jump down from the rock, and he slowly backed toward the mouth of the cleft. After putting a few yards between himself and the dead lady, he turned around and ran home as fast as he could. He no longer cared if he was scolded or not.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Sweat made the sheet stick to her body. Erica tossed and turned in bed, but it was impossible to find a comfortable position. The bright summer night didn&#x2019;t make it any easier to sleep, and for the thousandth time she made a mental note to buy some blackout curtains to hang up, or rather persuade Patrik to do it.<br> <br>It drove her crazy that he could sleep so contentedly next to her. How dare he lie there snoring when she lay awake night after night? She gave him a little poke in the hope that he&#x2019;d wake up. He didn&#x2019;t budge. She poked a little harder. He grunted, pulled the covers up and turned his back to her.<br> <br>With a sigh, she lay on her back with her arms crossed over her breasts and stared at the ceiling. Her belly arched into the air like a big globe, and she tried to imagine her baby swimming inside of her in the dark. Maybe with his thumb in his mouth. Although it was all still too unreal for her to be able to picture it. She was in her eighth month but still couldn&#x2019;t grasp the fact that she had another life inside her. Well, pretty soon it was going to be very real. Erica was torn between longing and dread. It was difficult to see beyond the childbirth. To be honest, right now it was hard to see beyond the problem of no longer being able to sleep on her stomach. She looked at the luminous dial of the alarm clock. 4:42 a.m. Maybe she should turn on the light and read for a while instead.<br> <br>Three and a half hours and one bad detective novel later, she was about to roll out of bed when the telephone rang shrilly. As usual she handed the receiver to Patrik.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, this is Patrik.&#x201d; His voice was thick with sleep. &#x201c;Okay, all right. Oh shit, yeah, I can be there in fifteen minutes. See you there.&#x201d;<br> <br>He turned to Erica. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got an emergency. I&#x2019;ve got to run.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re on vacation. Can&#x2019;t one of the others take it?&#x201d; She could hear that her voice sounded whiny, but lying awake all night hadn&#x2019;t done much for her mood.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a murder. Mellberg wants me to come along. He&#x2019;s going out there himself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A murder? Where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here in Fj�llbacka. A little boy found a woman&#x2019;s body in the King&#x2019;s Cleft this morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patrik threw on his clothes, which didn&#x2019;t take long since it was the middle of July and he only needed light summer clothes. Before he rushed out the door he climbed onto the bed and kissed Erica on the belly, somewhere near where she vaguely recalled she once had a navel.<br> <br>&#x201c;See you later, baby. Be nice to Mamma, and I&#x2019;ll be home soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>He kissed her quickly on the cheek and hurried off. With a sigh Erica hoisted herself out of bed and put on one of those tentlike dresses that for the time being were the only things that fit her. Against her better judgment she had read lots of baby books, and in her opinion everyone who wrote about the joyful experience of pregnancy ought to be taken out in the public square and horsewhipped. Insomnia, sore joints, stretch marks, hemorrhoids, night sweats and a general hormonal upheaval&#x2014;that was closer to the truth. And she sure as hell wasn&#x2019;t glowing with any inner radiance. Erica muttered to herself as she slowly made her way downstairs in pursuit of the day&#x2019;s first cup of coffee. Maybe that would lift the fog a bit.<br> <br>By the time Patrik arrived, a feverish amount of activity was already under way. The mouth of the King&#x2019;s Cleft had been cordoned off with yellow tape, and he counted three police cars and an ambulance. The techs from Uddevalla were busy with their work and he knew better than to walk right into the crime scene. That was a rookie mistake, which didn&#x2019;t prevent his boss, Superintendent Mellberg, from stomping around among them. They looked in dismay at his shoes and clothing, which at that very moment were adding thousands of fibers and particles to their sensitive workplace. When Patrik stopped outside the tape and motioned to his boss, Mellberg climbed back over the cordon, to the great relief of Forensics.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Hedstr�m,&#x201d; said the superintendent.<br> <br>His voice was hearty, bordering on joyful, and Patrik was taken aback. For a moment he thought that Mellberg was about to give him a hug but thankfully, this turned out to be wrong. Nevertheless, the man appeared completely changed. It was only a week since Patrik had gone on vacation, but the man before him was really not the same one he&#x2019;d left sitting sullenly at his desk, muttering that the very concept of vacations ought to be abolished.<br> <br>Mellberg eagerly pumped Patrik&#x2019;s hand and slapped him on the back.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, how&#x2019;s it going with the brooding hen at home? Any sign that you&#x2019;re going to be a father soon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not for a month and a half, they say.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patrik still had no idea what had brought on such good humor on Mellberg&#x2019;s part, but he pushed aside his surprise and tried to concentrate on the reason he&#x2019;d been called to the scene.<br> <br>&#x201c;So what have you found?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mellberg made an effort to wipe the smile off his face and pointed toward the shadowy interior of the cleft.<br> <br>&#x201c;A six-year-old boy sneaked out early this morning while his parents were asleep and came here to play knights among the boulders. Instead he found a dead woman. We got the call at six fifteen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long has Forensics had to examine the crime scene?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They arrived an hour ago.

Her hands and feet had been bagged according to regulations to preserve any evidence. The team of forensic officers from Uddevalla worked together to get the woman into the body bag in the most efficient way possible. Then the blanket she was lying on also had to be put in a plastic bag for later examination.<br> <br>The shocked expression on their faces and the way they froze instantly told Patrik that something unexpected had happened.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he called.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to believe this,&#x201d; said one of the officers, &#x201c;but there are bones here.

And world domination. <i>Itch</i> is as action-packed and suspenseful as a novel for young readers can get!<br><br>Fourteen-year-old Itchingham Lofte, nicknamed Itch, has an unusual passion: collecting specimens of every element in the periodic table. So what if that means he's had a few ... mishaps? But when he gets his hands on a suspiciously warm rock made of a new, previously unknown element, things really begin to explode. Soon, a malevolent teacher, an evil-doing corporation, and a top-secret government agency are all after Itch. Can his science know-how keep him one step ahead of everyone...and help him stay alive?&nbsp;A 2013 Parents' Choice Award Winner: Silver Medal.&nbsp;<b><i>Cover and jacket flap feature augmented reality animations via a free downloadable</i> Itch <i>app!</i>&nbsp; </b></p><p>Simon Mayo is one of Britain's best-loved and well-known radio DJs.

Simon lives in England.<br>"Collecting stamps is boring. Why not start a more exciting collection, like dangerous elements?Itchingham Lofte never meant to get himself, his cousin, and his sister sick with radiation poisoning. He never meant to attract the attention of heartless corporations and evil terrorist groups. He certainly never meant to provoke his science teacher into attack mode. But Itch has an unusual, dangerous hobby&#x2014;he collects the elements from the Periodic Table. And when one of his contacts delivers an unusual rock, Itch is thrilled. Instead of being afraid, he's excited when the Geiger counter at school goes wild in reaction to the radioactive rock. But then begins the complicated task of finding a safe place for the amazing rock&#x2014;and seven more just like it&#x2014;while avoiding the ruthless people who want to use the element toward disastrous ends. British radio host and debut novelist Mayo delivers a fun, frightening, gutsy adventure story populated by heroic young people who refuse to back down from their save-the-world mission, even as their treasure renders them sick.

His field work has taken him to a wide range of prehistoric sites, from the Canadian Arctic to north Africa, southern Russia, and the Dordogne Valley in France, where he now directs an excavation of the 35,000-year old settlement at Abri Castanet. The author of many books and articles, White is also a consultant to <i>Time, Newsweek, Natural History</i>, and other magazines. He lives in New York City and Montignac, France.About 40,000 years ago the first Homo sapiens--the Cro-Magnons--began to trickle into Europe, displacing the resident Neanderthals in the process. The contrast between the records of their lives that these very different hominids left behind could hardly be more striking. For no extinct human species, not even the large-brained Homo neanderthalensis, has bequeathed us evidence of a complex symbolic existence, based on the extraordinary cognitive capacities that distinguish us from all other living species today. In contrast, the lives of the Cro-Magnons were drenched in symbolism. Well over 30,000 years ago these early people were creating astonishing art on the walls of caves. They crafted subtle and beautiful carvings and engravings and kept records by incising intricate notations on bone plaques. They made music on bone flutes, and if they did this, they surely sang and danced as well. They ornamented their bodies and buried their dead with elaborate grave goods, presumably to serve them in an afterlife. Technologically, a cascade of innovations included nets, textiles and ropes, even the first ceramics. In short, those Cro-Magnons were us: members of a species whose relationship with the rest of the world was totally unprecedented in the entire history of life. For a couple of decades now, New York University archaeologist Randy White has been a leading investigator of how the expression of the unique human capacity unfolded in Europe during the two dozen millennia that followed the arrival of the Cro-Magnons. In this thoughtful and very beautiful book, White concentrates on the most dazzling part of this record, the part that embraces what we would call art--and that includes some of the most powerful ever made. But he is careful to point out that "art" is very much a Western concept and that for its creators, what looks to us like art probably had implications vastly different from those we impute in our own society to art and decoration. For while nobody could doubt that Cro-Magnon symbolic production somehow reflected these people's conceptions of their place in the natural world, the Cro-Magnons were hunters and gatherers, with a perceived relationship to nature that must have been radically different from our own. For this reason, White eschews the elaborate explanations that so many authors feel somehow obliged to bring to the interpretation of prehistoric art and hews to the facts. He begins with a brief history of the discovery and interpretation of Cro-Magnon art, as prelude to a largely chronological account of the evidence for symbolic expression in Europe and parts of northern Asia between about 40,000 and 10,000 years ago. In these sections, White mostly avoids stylistic analysis in favor of a focus on techniques, but he manages to address, if usually briefly, most of the major questions that Cro-Magnon art elicits. As perhaps befits a work that grew out of a university survey course, this volume extends beyond mainly European Ice Age art to consider prehistoric symbolic and representational traditions (some earlier, others quite recent) in Africa, southern and western Asia, Australia, and the Americas. Each of these regional groupings is treated separately, and White wisely refrains from drawing close parallels between different regional traditions. Of course, including all these diverse traditions between the covers of a single book might be taken to imply a unity that contradicts White's insistence on the unique cultural roots and referents of each one of them. But the fact that all are the products of hunting-gathering peoples serves very usefully to remind us of the vast range of iconographies and aesthetics available even to noncomplex human societies. What White's spectacularly illustrated book does most clearly, then, is to bring home the astonishing diversity and intricacy of the representational traditions that the extraordinary human symbolic spirit has from the beginning produced worldwide, even in the absence of complex social and economic structures. The remarkable human cognitive capacity that early art reflects appeared quite recently, perhaps less than 100,000 years ago. And that appearance set our species on a course of accelerating technological change and elaboration that may yet run out of our control. But White shows that although our economic lives have changed out of recognition in that time, the potential that underwrites our modern lifestyles and achievements was there from the very start. Deep down, human beings haven't changed one whit since prehistoric times. <p><i>Ian Tattersall is a curator of physical anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

There is Booker, the man Bride loves, and loses to anger. Rain, the mysterious white child with whom she crosses paths. And finally, Bride&#x2019;s mother herself, Sweetness, who takes a lifetime to come to understand that &#x201c;what you do to children matters. And they might never forget.&#x201d;<br><br>A fierce and provocative novel that adds a new dimension to the matchless oeuvre of Toni Morrison.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2015:</strong> &#x201c;What you do to children matters...&#x201d; This foreboding phrase informs the latest masterful novel by Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison. The story, at its heart, is about the devastating consequences of a light-skinned mother who rejects her dark-skinned child. Bride, the daughter, goes on to become a successful cosmetics mogul, but that success doesn&#x2019;t translate to her personal life--Her inability to heal from childhood wounds stunts (even literally) her growth. Anyone familiar with Morrison&#x2019;s oeuvre knows that she isn&#x2019;t shy about lingering uncomfortably long in the bleakest of places, and at times the weight of this slender book seems almost too much to bear. But where there is darkness there is light, at least in Bride&#x2019;s case, and this contrast serves to make her attempts at reshaping her destiny that much sweeter. And that is one of the most important and empowering lessons of <em>God Help the Child</em>--that the sins of others need not define you, that what is done to children indeed matters. But how children&#x2014;so vulnerable and yet so resilient--can overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles matters all the more.<em> &#x2013;Erin Kodicek</em></p>TONI MORRISON is the author of eleven novels, from <i>The Bluest Eye</i> (1970) to <i>Home</i> (2012).

He examines the phallic and other sexually oriented structures, found in our own country, that reveal the beliefs of ancient Celtic fertility cults - cults that were virtually destroyed in Europe in early Christian times. Further evidence has been found in the tombs of kings and chiefs, in the form of steles - written testimonies of grief carved in stone.</p><p></p><h2>Censured for Curing Cancer: The American Experience of Dr. Max Gerson</h2><p>Book about groundbreaking cancer researcher forced underground by the system.</p><p></p><h2>Lonely Planet Canada (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet Canada </i></b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Changed by the rigors of battle into an impassive killing machine, Michael finds it hard to settle back into his previous life and settle down with high-school girlfriend Patty Ann O'Hara (she of the dimples and Lana Turner figure). So when former "Untouchable" Eliot Ness, now heading a federal office charged with "safeguarding the health and morale of the armed forces," asks him to take on a perilous undercover gig--infiltrating Capone's syndicate in order to curb its criminal enterprises--Michael can't agree fast enough. He blames the ex-Alcatraz inmate for his father's slaying, and sees in this assignment the prospect for retribution. However, as Michael worms his way into the mob, gaining the trust of Capone lieutenant Frank Nitti, winning the heart of celebrity madam Estelle Carey (a woman with her own risky agenda), and planning a deadly assault on Scarface at his Miami estate, Michael discovers that ascribing blame and exacting justice aren't the easy tasks he'd imagined. He also learns that he's more like his late father than he had realized--a point emphasized in a 1922 flashback, which finds Michael O'Sullivan Sr. rescuing Irish gang boss John Looney and protecting Looney's ruthless scion.</p><p> Collins's two decades of experience writing about World War II-era Chicago crime, mostly in his Shamus Award-winning Nate Heller detective series ( <i>Angel in Black</i>, <i>Chicago Confidential</i>), shows in <i>Purgatory</i>'s copious period atmospherics and its nuanced portrayals of Capone and company.

Or so I told myself. Later, I'd question that, as I would question pretty much everything I knew about me, my relationships, and my desires. It all began when my neighbor thrust a key to a storage unit at me. She'd bought it to make extra money after watching some storage auction show. Now she was on her way to the airport to elope with a man she barely knew, and she needed me to clear out the unit before the lease expired.<br><br>Soon, I was standing inside a small room that held the intimate details of another woman's life, feeling uncomfortable, as if I was invading her privacy. Why had she let these items so neatly packed, possessions that she clearly cared about deeply, be lost at an auction? Driven to find out by some unnamed force, I began to dig, to discover this woman's life, and yes, read her journals--dark, erotic journals that I had no business reading. Once I started, I couldn't stop. I read on obsessively, living out fantasies through her words that I'd never dare experience on my own, compelled by the three men in her life, none of whom had names. I read onward until the last terrifying dark entry left me certain that something had happened to this woman. I had to find her and be sure she was okay.<br><br>Before long, I was taking her job for the summer at the art gallery, living her life, and she was nowhere to be found. I was becoming someone I didn't know. I was becoming her.<br><br><b>The dark, passion it becomes...</b><br><br>Now, I am working at a prestigious gallery, where I have always dreamed of being, and I've been delivered to the doorstep of several men, all of which I envision as one I've read about in the journal. But there is one man that will call to me, that will awaken me in ways I never believed possible. That man is the ruggedly sexy artist, Chris Merit, who wants to paint me. He is rich and famous, and dark in ways I shouldn't find intriguing, but I do. I so do. I don't understand why his dark side appeals to me, but the attraction between us is rich with velvety promises of satisfaction. Chris is dark, and so are his desires, but I cannot turn away. He is damaged beneath his confident good looks and need for control, and in some way, I feel he needs me. I need him.<br><br>All I know for certain is that he knows me like I don't even know me, and he says I know him. Still, I keep asking myself -- do I know him? Did he know her, the journal writer, and where is she? And why doesn't it seem to matter anymore? There is just him and me, and the burn for more.</p><p><b>Did you know this series is being developed for cable TV?

Without self-esteem everyone loses his or her sense of meaning, purpose, and power. For too long, African Americans in particular have been unable to openly and honestly address the crisis of self-esteem and how it affects the way they perceive themselves and are perceived by others. In her most challenging and provocative book to date, bell hooks gives voice to what many black people have thought and felt, but seldom articulated. She offers readers a clear, passionate examination of the role self-esteem plays in the African-American experience in determining whether individuals or groups succeed or self-sabotage. She considers the reasons why even among &#34;the best and brightest&#34; students at Ivy League institutions &#34;there were young men and women beset by deep feelings of unworthiness, of ugliness inside and outside.&#34; She listened to the stories of her students and her peers -- baby boomers who had excelled -- and heard the same sentiments, including deep feelings of inadequacy. With critical insight, hooks exposes the underlying truth behind the crisis: it has been extremely difficult to create a culture that promotes and sustains a healthy sense of self-esteem in African-American communities. With true brilliance, she rigorously examines and identifies the barriers -- political and cultural -- that keep African Americans from emotional well-being. She looks at historical movements as well as parenting and how we make and sustain community. She discusses the revolutionary role preventative mental health care can play in promoting and maintaining self-esteem. Blending keen intellectual insight and practical wisdom, Rock My Soul provides a blueprint for healing a people and a nation.</p><p><b>bell hooks</b> is a distinguished professor of English, cultural critic, feminist theorist, and writer, who divides her time among teaching, writing, and lecturing around the world.

For many folks it conjures up images of self-help issues that were popular "back in the day." Indeed, in our nation public talk about self-esteem was at its highest in the sixties. Then the United States, one of the most powerful and wealthy nations in the world, was producing citizens who were simply discontent with their lot in life, who saw themselves as failures. Many of these individuals had come from upper-class backgrounds, were educated at the best schools, prospered in jobs and careers, moved in elite social circles, and yet found themselves unable to feel truly successful or enjoy life. They went to psychologists seeking a way to gain health for the mind. These individuals were white Americans. Psychology of the fifties had little to say about the psyches and souls of black folks. </p><p> In 1954 Nathaniel Branden had a small psychotherapy practice. His clients were all white but from diverse class backgrounds. Working with their issues, he began to focus on the issue of self-esteem. Branden recalls: "Reflecting on the stories I heard from clients, I looked for a common denominator, and I was struck by the fact that whatever the person's particular complaint, there was always a deeper issue: a sense of inadequacy, of not being 'enough,' a feeling of guilt or shame or inferiority, a clear lack of self-acceptance, self-trust, and self-love. In other words, a problem of self-esteem." He published his first articles on the psychology of self-esteem in the sixties. </p><p> Racial integration was hotly debated in the early sixties. The issue of whether black people were inferior to whites and therefore would be unable to do well in an integrated work or school context was commonly discussed. Racist white folks insisted everyone did better when they stayed with their own kind. And there were black folks who agreed with them. When the issue of self-esteem was raised in relation to black people, it was just assumed that racism was the primary factor creating low self-esteem. Consequently, when black public figures, most of whom were male at the time, began to address the issue of self-esteem, they focused solely on the impact of racism as a force that crippled our self-esteem. </p><p> Militant antiracist political struggles placed the issue of self-esteem for black folks on the agenda. And it took the form of primarily discussing the need for positive images. The slogan "black is beautiful" was popularized in an effort to undo the negative racist iconography and representations of blackness that had been an accepted norm in visual culture. Natural hairstyles were offered to counter the negative stereotype that one could be beautiful only if one's hair was straight and not kinky. "Happy to be nappy" was also a popular slogan among militant black liberation groups. Even black folks whose hair was not naturally kinky found ways to make their hair look nappy to be part of the black-is-beautiful movement. Capitalist entrepeneurs, white and black, welcomed the creation of a new market -- that is, material goods related to black pride (African clothing, picks for hair, black dolls). Market forces were pleased to support the aspect of black pride that was all about new commodities. </p><p> Now pride in blackness already existed in every black community in the United States. While its cultural power may never have eliminated internalized racial self-hatred, the movement for racial uplift that began the moment individual free black folks came to the "New World," combined with the force of slave resistance, had already established the cultural foundations for black pride way before the fifties, even though the term self-esteem was not a part of the popular discourse of racial uplift. Writing on the subject of black pride in "Credo" in 1904, W. E. B. Du Bois declared,<br> </p><p> I believe in pride of race and lineage and self....I believe in Liberty for all men, the space to stretch their arms and their souls, the right to breathe and the right to vote, the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine, and the right to vote, the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of God and Love. I believe in the training of children, black even as white; the leading out of little souls into the green pastures and beside the still waters, not for self, or peace, but for Life lit by some large vision of beauty and goodness and truth.<br> </p><p> Du Bois advocated working for racial uplift because he was not afraid to examine the ways racism had kept black folks from fully realizing their potential for human development. </p><p> This same demand for holistic self-development rooted in black pride was the foundation of the black women's club movement. Speaking in 1916 on the subject of "The Modern Woman," black woman leader Mary Church Terrell shared her vision of the special mission of educated black women: "We have to do more than other women. Those of us fortunate enough to have education must share it with the less fortunate of our race. We must go into our communities and improve them; we must go out into the nation and change it. Above all, we must organize ourselves as Negro women and work together." A militant spirit of racial uplift was the unifying principle of the black women's club movement throughout the nation. The issue was not just to confront and resist racism but to create a culture of freedom and possiblity that would enable all black folks irrespective of class to engage in constructive self-help. </p><p> The call for racial uplift in the early twentieth century was not a superficial evocation of black pride; instead it was truly a call for this newly freed mass population of Americans, African and those of African descent, to strive to be fully self-actualized. To some extent the black pride movement of the sixties, with its intense focus on representation, shifted attention away from the moral and ethical demands of racial uplift, its spiritual dimension, and focused solely on the issue of gaining equality with whites. The psyches and souls of black folks needed to be nourished as much as did the individual's need for material goods and basic civil rights in the public sphere. Yet more often than not the inner psychological development of black folks was ignored by those black public figures who were most concerned with gaining equal access within the existing social system. </p><p> No wonder then that after major civil rights were gained and militant black power movement had increased social and economic opportunities, the focus on black pride diminished. The need for an organized ongoing program of racial uplift, though acknowledged, never gained meaningful momentum. This may have been a direct consequence of the waning power of black female leadership, especially the political leadership fostered by the black women's club movement. Though often guilty of class elitism, black women in the club movement held values focused on holistic self-development for black people of all classes. Black folks were encouraged to have proper etiquette and manners, to be people of integrity, to educate themselves, to work hard, to be religious, and to value service to others. Indeed, the phrase "racial uplift through self-help" was a common slogan used in black women's organizations. </p><p> In the early twentieth century prominent black male leaders began to demand of black women that they cease working in an egalitarian manner alongside black men for racial uplift. This demand changed the tenor and tone of black civil rights struggle. In the twenties patriarchal black male leaders pointedly told black women to step back from the social and political realms. Black nationalism became the vehicle to push black patriarchal values. As a new leader Marcus Garvey used his newspaper, <i>The Negro World,</i> to advocate sexist thinking about the nature of women's role. Articles ran in the paper urging black folks to "go back to the days of true manhood when women truly reverenced us." This resistance to partnership in struggle reached a peak in the early sixties. </p><p> When Daniel Patrick Moynihan, in his role as assistant secretary of labor, wrote the report "The Negro Family: The Case for National Action," his intent, as explained in <i>Too Heavy a Load</i> by historian Deborah Gray White, was "to alert government policy makers to the problems in black America that went beyond desegreation and voting." She contends: "He aimed to demonstrate that neither the Civil Rights movement nor Civil Rights legislation had made an impact on black everyday life. Indeed, the report's survey of unemployment, housing, school dropout rates, crime and delinquency, and intelligence tests revealed that over ten years of Civil Rights protests and national upheaval had not changed the fundamental living conditions of most African-Americans." </p><p> Following in the wake of conservative black male patriarchs (in particular the sociologist John Hope Franklin), Moynihan felt the key to black underdevelopment was the lack of patriarchal gender arrangements in black homes. In his report he stated: "Ours is a society which presumes male leadership in private and public affairs. The arrangements of society facilitate and reward it. A subculture, such as that of the Negro American, in which this is not the pattern, is placed at a distinct disadvantage." When black liberation struggle moved from a focus on mutual racial uplift of black males and females to an insistence that black men dominate and black women maintain a subordinate position, the focus on holistic development shifted to gaining equality with white men. Civil rights movement coupled with militant, patriarchal black liberation struggle successfully challenged the nation so that black people gained greater rights. Racial integration effectively created a cultural context where it was at least clearer to everyone that given equal opportunity, black citizens would excel or fail depending on circumstance just like white citizens. </p><p> Ulitmately, like their white counterparts, black folks in this nation gained greater economic privileges, civil rights, all manner of equality, and yet found that even with all these progressive changes all was not well with their souls, that many of them were lacking in self-esteem. In many cases black females subordinated themselves to black males, but black men were still discontent. Two-parent black families had many of the same woes as single-parent homes. Yet while white folks were looking to progressive psychology to soothe their psyches, their discontent, black leaders more than ever before in African-American history named racism as the central culprit disturbing the peace in our lives. </p><p> These same leaders responded to struggles for gender equality by acting as though greater freedom for black females was a covert attack on black males. Prior to such thinking it was merely assumed that any gains black females made were gains for the race as a whole. In all their activism black women in the early part of the twentieth century continually insisted that gender equality enhanced the struggle for black liberation. Such thinking lost momentum as patriarchal thinking became more an accepted norm for black males and females. Militant black power Panther spokesperson Eldridge Cleaver told the world in his 1968 international bestseller <i>Soul on Ice</i> that the black woman was the "silent ally...of the white man," who used her to destroy black manhood. Labeling black females "race traitors" should have galvanized masses of black females and males to protest. Instead, there was widespread agreement on the part of black males and females who were socialized to accept patriarchal thinking without question that black male development would be furthered by the subordination of black women. </p><p> Plenty of political black women responded to the black male insistence that patriarchal domination by black men was the only way to heal the wounds of racism by standing behind their men. Activist Margaret Wright clearly saw the contradictions: "Black men used to admire the black woman for all they'd endured to keep the race going. Now the black man is saying he wants a family structure like the white man's. He's got to be head of the family and women have to be submissive and all that nonsense...the white woman is already oppressed in that setup." The lone individuals, female and male, who had the foresight to see that gender warfare would undermine the historical solidarity in struggle between black women and men and lead to more havoc in black family life could not sway political opinion in a progressive direction. </p><p> Black women who joined feminist movement, whether in separatist or integrated contexts, risked being labeled race traitors, but that did not lead to silence. By the late seventies and early eighties individual black women active in feminist movement were making our voices heard loud and clear, but we were no longer recognized as leaders or would-be leaders in our diverse black communities. Just supporting feminism, and using the word, allowed many black folks to ignore the valid social and political critiques that we were making. </p><p> Being labeled a race traitor was devastating to the self-esteem of black women who had found in antiracist struggle a basis on which to build positive self-concepts. To be told that the black woman's efforts to end racism were detrimental to the race was incredibly confusing to many black females. Black nationalism alone did not give credence to patriarchal thinking. Fundamentalist Christian thinking about gender roles had been deeply embedded in the social thought of black folks from slavery on into freedom. That rhetoric joined with the patriarchal rhetoric of conservative black nationalism, reinforcing in the minds and hearts of black males and females alike that male domination of women should be the norm. </p><p> Ironically, the insistence that patriarchy would heal the wounds inflicted by white supremacy and racial terrorism gained momentum at precisely that historical moment when affluent white women were telling the world that all was not well in the homes of Dick and Jane. Domestic violence, incest, depression, and all manner of addiction and mental illness were identified as the plight white females suffered in affluent marriages. Concurrently, feminist movement made it possible for more men than ever before in our nation to protest the way patriarchal masculinity crippled the psyches and souls of men. Progressive white men questioning patriarchy were not listened to by black males who wanted patriarchal power. The equation of power with self-esteem was the faulty thinking that would ultimately trap black males. </p><p> Even though Martin Luther King, Jr., had warned black folks and all citizens of this nation in his collection of sermons <i>Strength to Love,</i> first published in 1963, that we would endanger our souls if we ignored the interrelatedness of all life, if we chose violence over peace, hatred over love, materialism over communalism, his words were not fully embraced. Yet his insights were clearly prophetic. Now, more than thirty years later, his declaration that "we have foolishly m...</p></p><h2>Irene: The Commandant Camille Verhoeven Trilogy (The Commandant Camille Verhoeven Trilogy (1))</h2><p>Pierre Lemaitre is known for writing crime fiction with an alchemical mix of white-knuckle intensity, fearlessly unconventional plotting, and psychologically intricate character development. In <em>Irene</em> Lemaitre ingeniously uses five contemporary and classic literary murder scenes--from William McIlvanney's Laidlaw to Bret Easton Ellis's <em>American Psycho</em>--as the framework on which to craft a diabolical prequel to his Crime Writers' Association International Dagger Award-winning novel <em>Alex</em>.<br>Camille Verhoeven, whose diminutive stature belies his fierce intensity, has reached an unusually content (for him) place in life. he is respected by his colleagues and he and his lovely wife, Irene, are expecting their first child.<br>But when a new murder case hits his desk--a double torture-homicide that's so extreme that even the most seasoned officers are horrified-Verhoeven is overcome with a sense of foreboding. <br>As links emerge between the bloody set-piece and at least one past unsolved murder, it becomes clear that a calculating serial killer is at work. The press has a field day, taking particular pleasure in putting Verhoeven under the media spotlight (and revealing uncomfortable details of his personal life). <br>Then Verhoeven makes a breakthrough discovery: the murders are modeled after the exploits of serial killers from classic works of crime fiction. The double murder was an exquisitely detailed replication of a scene from Bret Easton Ellis's <em>American Psycho</em>, and one of the linked cold cases was a faithful homage to James Ellroy's <em>The Black Dahlia</em>. <br>The media circus reaches a fever pitch when the modus operandi of the killer, dubbed "The Novelist," is revealed. Worse, the Novelist has taken to writing taunting letters to the police, emphasizing that he will stop leaving any clues behind unless Verhoeven remains on the case. <br>For reasons known only to the killer, the case has become personal. With more literature--inspired murders surfacing, Verhoeven enlists the help of an eccentric bookseller and a professor specializing in crime fiction to try to anticipate his adversary's next move. Then Irene is kidnapped.<br>With time running out, Verhoeven realizes that all along he's been the unwitting dupe in The Novelist's plans to create an original work of his own.

Quirky, brutal and not for the faint-hearted, it is crime fiction of the highest class . . . Superbly constructed and executed, it puts Lemaitre very close to Ellroy&#x2019;s class.

The urgency of Perloo's situation, when he's called to assume the position of "granter" for his race, will hold readers rapt. Torn between a chance for glory and a longing to crawl back to his burrow and curl up with a good book of history and a cup of tea with honey, Perloo will charm both fantasy and adventure-loving children alike.

Beginning in the 16th century, European outposts in the New World, especially those in New Spain, became a major nexus of the Asian export trade. Craftsmen from Canada to Peru, inspired by the sophisticated designs and advanced techniques of these imported goods, combined Asian styles with local traditions to produce unparalleled furniture, silverwork, textiles, ceramics, lacquer, painting and architectural ornaments. <br>Among the exquisite objects featured in this book, from across the hemisphere and spanning the 17th to the early 19th centuries, are folding screens made in Mexico in imitation of imported Japanese and Chinese screens; blue-and-white talavera ceramics copied from Chinese porcelains; luxuriously woven textiles, made to replicate fine silks and cottons from China and India; devotional statues that adapt Buddhist gods into Christian saints; and "japanned" furniture produced in Boston that simulates Asian lacquer finishes. The stories told by the objects gathered in <i>Made in the Americas</i> bring to life the rich cultural interchange and the spectacular arts of the first global age.</p><p>Dennis Carr earned his Master's degree in Higher Education Administration from Boston College with a concentration in Catholic University Leadership.<br><br>Dennis Carr is Carolyn and Peter Lynch Curator of American Decorative Arts and Sculpture, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

This difficult task fell largely to the U.S., which, at the outset, lacked the necessary men, materiel, and training. Over the ensuing years, thanks to visionary leadership and diligent effort, the U.S. Army Air Force developed strategies and tactics and assembled a well-trained force that convincingly defeated the Luftwaffe.</p><p>"Jay Stout turns back the calendar from his perch in a Hornet strike fighter in the 1990s to the flak-studded skies of Europe and the Mediterranean in World War II. Employing alternating micro-macro perspectives, he provides an excellent overview of the U.S. Army Air Force's war against Nazi Germany. The views are comprehensive: from training in the States to combat units overseas, AAF headquarters, and Allied war councils at the highest levels. Both buffs and historians will find something of interest in this well-researched history." <br>--Barrett Tillman, author of <i>Whirlwind: The Air War against Japan</i> <p>"A marvelously written work! Stout, a former fighter pilot himself, presents stirring firsthand accounts of the strategies and doctrines that ultimately won the air war over Europe. As close to a complete account of the USAAF war against Germany as has ever been written. Enthusiastically recommended!" <br>--Col. Walter J. Boyne, USAF (Ret.), former director of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum </p><p>"As always, air combat veteran Jay Stout creates a spellbinding and authoritative narrative by asking--and getting answers to--important and illuminating questions no other author on the topic has ever even thought of." <br>--Eric Hammel, author of <i>The Road to Big Week: The Struggle for Daylight Air Supremacy over Western Europe</i> </p><p>"A colossal undertaking that delivers brilliantly. In a tale that captivates the reader and pulls him into the cockpit, Jay Stout weaves the strategic underpinnings of the air war over Europe together with the words of the men who fought it. Both the historian and pilot will recognize Stout's carefully detailed analysis of the war's men and machines in an account that leaves no stone unturned, no myth unbroken. This work lifts above the fray and is reminiscent of Ambrose's Citizen Soldier." <br>--Michael Franzak, author of <i>A Nightmare's Prayer: A Marine Harrier Pilot's War in Afghanistan</i></p>When World War II began, the U.S. Army Air Corps numbered only 45,000 men and a few thousand aircraft--hardly enough to defend the United States, let alone defeat Germany's Luftwaffe, the world's most formidable air force. Yet by the war's end, the Luftwaffe had been crushed, and the U.S. Army Air Forces, successor to the Air Corps, had delivered the decisive blows. <i>The Men Who Killed the Luftwaffe</i> tells the story of that striking transformation--one of the marvels of modern warfare--while simultaneously thrusting readers into whirling, heart-pounding accounts of aerial combat. <p>The Allies couldn't defeat Hitler's Third Reich without destroying its industry and taking its territory, but before they could do either, they had to neutralize the Luftwaffe, whose state-of-the-art aircraft and battle-seasoned pilots stood ready to batter any attackers. Great Britain's Royal Air Force was only barely holding the line, and the might of the United States was needed to turn the tide. </p><p>Almost from scratch, the United States built an air force of more than two million men. Thanks to the visionary leadership of Henry "Hap" Arnold, Carl "Tooey" Spaatz, Ira Eaker, James Doolittle, and others, the USAAF assembled a well-trained and superbly equipped force unlike any ever fielded. And thanks to the brave Americans who crewed, maintained, and supported the aircraft, the USAAF annihilated the Luftwaffe as it pounded targets deep inside Germany and elsewhere. </p><p>A stirring tribute to these men as well as an engaging work of history, <i>The Men Who Killed the Luftwaffe</i> vividly describes World War II in the skies above Europe. At the same time, it captures the personalities of the men who won it, whether on the ground or in the sky.</p></p><h2>Lemuria The Lost Continent of the Pacific</h2><p>Beneath the rollings seas lie the mysteries of forgotten civilizations.

Shaka is today the hero of Zulu nationalism, the centerpiece of Inkatha ideology, a demon of apartheid, the namesake of a South African theme park, even the subject of a major TV film.</p><p><i>Terrific Majesty</i>explores the reasons for the potency of Shaka's image, examining the ways it has changed over time--from colonial legend, through Africanist idealization, to modern cultural icon. This study suggests that "tradition" cannot be freely invented, either by European observers who recorded it or by subsequent African ideologues. There are particular historical limits and constraints that operate on the activities of invention and imagination and give the various images of Shaka their power. These insights are illustrated with subtlety and authority in a series of highly original analyses.</p><p><i>Terrific Majesty</i> is an exceptional work whose special contribution lies in the methodological lessons it delivers; above all its sophisticated rehabilitation of colonial sources for the precolonial period, through the demonstration that colonial texts were critically shaped by indigenous African discourse. With its sensitivity to recent critical studies, the book will also have a wider resonance in the fields of history, anthropology, cultural studies, and post-colonial literature.</p></p><p>Carolyn Hamilton is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa.Carolyn Hamilton's new book is not a history of Shaka; it is rather a history of the histories of Shaka, an attempt to understand [its] changing presentations. This might, at first glance, seem a thoroughly postmodern kind of project, hinting at a fascination with history as representation rather than a concern with what actually happened in the past. But at its best it is more than this, as Hamilton presents very real debates about what did happen, and she does so in the face of a profound, bitter and not infrequently violent historical controversy. (Justin Willis <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>As the title suggests, Hamilton's book is not a biography of Shaka, but rather an exploration of his evolution as an icon of African "tribalism" and Zulu nationalism...Hamilton spends little time on Shaka the man, devoting her attention instead to the different ways in which South African communities have chosen to remember him...Hamilton's study is extremely erudite, and her argument is well-grounded in the relevant literatures of history, anthropology, and cultural studies...The book makes an important contribution to the field of Southern African Studies, while drawing conclusions that have implications outside of Africa. (James Burns <i>Biography</i>)<br><br>The book is both a thoughtful disquisition on the irreducible ambiguity of knowing the past, and a work of rigorous deductive empiricism, in which the reliability of particular historical voices is interrogated. Hamilton shows the way elements of precolonial African authority were tendentiously apprehended by colonial officials, and contested by Africans, as a "Shaka" tradition. She rejects the idea that historical meaning is produced moment by moment; instead she shows how all reinterpretations of the Zulu kingdom have been constrained by popular traditions rooted in genuine historical experience...As a piece of scholarship, <i>Terrific Majesty</i> will be indispensable reading for students of the sources for Zulu history. More than this, and almost alone in recent Africanist scholarship, it is an effortless read. (Paul S. Landau <i>African Studies Quarterly</i>)<br><br>Hamilton's thought-provoking monograph on the persistence of Shaka as a metaphor in South African history and politics and the changing representations of the famous Zulu king over time constitutes a subtle excursion in philosophy of history and discourse analysis. Her major argument challenges most postmodernist interpretations of the Shakan legend by suggesting that Shaka was not simply a colonial invention...Hamilton deftly analyzes the construction of the Zulu past through a variety of discourses. (J. O. Gump <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>There is absolutely no doubt that this material deserves a wide audience. I am sure that on her central point Carolyn Hamilton is correct. That central point seems to me a commonsensical one, one that is only striking in the current moment in which it has been influentially denied: namely, that African (in this case, both Zulu and non-Zulu) representations shaped what V. Y. Mudimbe calls "the colonial library." (Anthony Appiah, author of <i>In My Father's House</i>)<br><br>The great originality of the book is that it demonstrates the way in which later representations of Shaka remain broadly true to the original discourse, formulated during Shaka's reign. This book also challenges post-modernist historiography, not by a lot of positivist tub-thumping, but by using the methods of discourse analysis to bring out the historical constraints on the various images of Shaka, and their roots in the actual situation of his reign. This book has no competitors: it is the first of its kind, certainly in precolonial and colonial studies. (Adam Kuper, author of <i>The Chosen Primate</i>)<br><br>Hamilton has brilliantly and with great clarity used the literary methodology of deconstruction to counter those who would see in colonial writing simply inventions of the "other." What Hamilton says has far wider implications for the possibilities of writing the history of preliterate peoples.There are historical constraints and limits attached to themetaphorical use of Shaka and of "Zuluness" which leave it open to different interpretations, but which have an irreducible core recoverable through careful sifting. The great value of Hamilton's work is that she shows how this can be done by actually doing it herself. (Shula Marks, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London)<br><br>She reveals the various ways in which the image of Shaka has been used in political struggles in eastern South Africa, from his lifetime right up to the present day. Her work has real relevance to contemporary politics, addressing the extreme bloodshed in Natal in the late 1980s, and the possibilities of drawing on the region's "heritage" to create the reconciled "rainbow nation" in the early 1990s...Hamilton's argument has significance well beyond the confines of Southern African studies. Her emphasis on the historical dynamics of invented traditions is salutary. Her insistence that local politics and cultural systems place limits on the invention of tradition carries lessons for all those who, following Edward Thompson, aim to rescue their subjects from "the enormous condescension of posterity." Her methodology, too, has wider application...Hamilton's book is inspiring, not least, because it suggests a life beyond post-modernist relativism.

Her divine beauty will lead her to a lifetime of adventure--from her kidnapping at age 12, through an arranged marriage, to a passionate affair that will ultimately bring about the Trojan War. <br><br>Cassandra, the sister of Helen's true love, has the gift, or curse, to predict the future. When she foresees the ruin of her family and city, caused by Helen's arrival in Troy, she is outraged. Yet Cassandra cannot help being drawn to Helen, and as the war rages around them, the two young women develop a deep friendship. <br><br>Through their eyes, the classic tale of the Trojan War is retold in an immediate and fascinating way.</p><p>Grade 8-10?What was it like to be the beauteous Helen of Troy, or to be Cassandra, the unappreciated visionary? This novel tries to offer some answers. It begins in the mind of 12-year-old Helen, abducted (but chastely treated) by Theseus, sought after by a dozen contentious suitors, married lovelessly to Menelaus, and finally?the only act in which she has not been completely passive?enthralled by passion in the form of Paris. If Helen, the victim of her own beauty and rank, is not exactly a heroine, Paris is far from a hero. He, too, is passive, blaming his actions on the will of the gods (particularly, Aphrodite), and is fonder of love and his own looks than he is of battle. Fortunately, almost two thirds of the novel is given to Cassandra. Her description of Helen as "bone sweet" does not, however, conform to the Helen we have met in Part I. Of course many readers will know the outcome of the story, but the accounts of battles, negotiations and stratagems, seen from within Troy, still manage to be suspenseful, and the ending is particularly deft. The writing is competent but not especially vivid and too often predictable; there is some clumsy exposition. Little differentiates the voice of Cassandra from the voice of Helen: both are misfits in their world, but their speech and thoughts lack individual identity. Nevertheless, the novel is carefully structured, there are some interesting historical details, and the idea of a woman's-eye view of The Iliad would seem timely. If this novel manages to introduce even a few more readers to the world of the ancient Greeks, it will be worth its shelf space.?Patricia (Dooley) Lothrop Green, St. George's School, Newport, RI<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.A retelling of the Trojan War from the point of view of Helen and Cassandra never catches fire in this first novel. The story is told in the first person, in Helen's voice in part one, Cassandra's in part two. All the familiar names are present: the strutting, moody Achilles; steady Odysseus; winsome Penelope; and Paris, whose promise from Aphrodite starts it all. McLaren portrays Helen as ``bone sweet''--as lovable as she is beautiful--and Cassandra as tormented physically and emotionally by her visions of the future. Nearly all the action takes place offstage or in exposition, and the relationships among all the women, which are at the heart of the tale, are not fully realized or complete.

In <i>Working Toward Whiteness</i> , he continues that history into the twentieth century, recounting how American ethnic groups that are considered white today, such as Jewish-, Italian-, and Polish-Americans, once occupied a confused racial status in their new country.While some historians have claimed that these immigrants were white on arrival,&#x201d; Roediger paints a very different picture, showing that it wasn't until the 1920s (ironically, just when immigration laws became much more restrictive), that these ethnic groups definitively became part of white America, primarily thanks to the nascent labor movement and a rise in home-buying.From ethnic slurs to racially restrictive covenants the real estate agreements that ensured all-white neighborhoods <i>Working Toward Whiteness</i> explores the murky realities of race in twentieth-century America. In this masterful history, which is sure to be a key text in its field, David Roediger charts the strange transformation of these new immigrants into the white ethnics&#x201d; of America today.</p><p><b>David R. Roediger</b> teaches on the history of race and class in the United States at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he is the Babcock Chair of History and of African American Studies. He lives in Champaign, Illinois.Too much recent scholarship "simply ignores the long, circuitous process by which 'new immigrants' became 'white ethnics,' " declares Roediger (<i>The Wages of Whiteness</i>), finding that the process in the early 20th century was slower and messier. Well-detailed examples include Greeks and Italians victimized by white mobs at the turn of the century (with the Chicago papers providing the parenthetical identification "Italian" in crime stories just as they did "Negro"). Jobs, Roediger finds, were often divided on lines that separated whites from European immigrants, but unions opened to European immigrants more readily than to blacks, Mexican-Americans and Asian-Americans. Most significantly, he sees the oppression faced by Europeans as qualitatively different than that faced by other groups and goes into painful detail. Roediger hearkens back to the 1924 immigration restrictions, showing how they drove the "great migration" of African-Americans northward, thus rendering immigrants less "foreign" to some entrenched whites. Reinforcing that were the immigrant drive for home ownership, backed by New Deal&#x2013;era restrictive racial covenants and laws against interracial marriage. While slow going, Roediger's book tills some major historical ground. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Many of the world&#39;s religions have not actively sought converts, largely because they have been too regional in character. Buddhism, Islam and Christianity, however, are the three chief exceptions to this, and Christianity in particular has found a home in almost every country in the world. Professor Stephen Neill&#39;s comprehensive and authoritative survey examines centuries of missionary activity, beginning with Christ and working through the Crusades and the colonization of Asia and Africa up to the present day, concluding with a shrewd look ahead to what the future may hold for the Christian Church.</p><p>Stephen Neill (1900-1984) was the Anglican Bishop of Tirunelveli in southern India.

Simultaneous.</p><p>Grade 4-6-Hetty McKinley, 12, travels to the Yukon with her widower father, uncle, and friends to find their fortune at the height of the 1897 Klondike Gold Rush. Along the difficult and arduous trail through the snowy Chilkoot Pass, family members' mementos begin to disappear. Who could it be and why would someone be stealing items that only hold sentimental value? The hardship of the trip, the relationships that develop, and the lessons learned change Hetty, her friend Alma, and the other travelers as they make their way to Dawson City. Steiner has woven historical details into her scenes and characters. Many of the episodes reflect some of the writings of Jack London; in fact, the writer himself makes a cameo appearance. Hetty is by far the strongest figure in this story of struggle, intrigue, suspense, and adventure. An informative appendix complete with photos and a map of the Klondike Gold Rush gives readers a clearer idea of the trials and triumphs depicted here. This is a worthy addition to the series; interested readers can move on to Jack London's Call of the Wild for a classic description of this era.<br><i>Rita Soltan, Baldwin Public Library, Birmingham, MI </i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 5-8. In September 1897, 12-year-old Hetty, her father, and Uncle Donall, as well as her best friend, Alma, and Alma's mother, join thousands of adventurers heading for the Klondike goldfields. Although the prospect of finding gold is alluring, the trip will be punishing; they must haul three tons of supplies through the mountains to the Golden Stairs, the final brutal ascent to Chilkoot Pass, and then 500 miles north to Dawson. What Hetty is not prepared for are problems that plague them from the minute they leave the steamer: supplies damaged by water, the thefts of money and small treasures, Uncle Donall's friendship with a wealthy socialite, illness, blizzards, and an avalanche. Steiner's adventure mystery is a real page-turner and a good addition to the History Mysteries series. She captures all the drama and danger of the Klondikers' trek and infuses it with just the right amount of historical details to give readers a satisfying, action-filled story. <i>Chris Sherman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This is the beginning of the ceremony.<br><br>3. Stop and button your collar all the way to the neck.<br><br>4. Stand over the ball and look up at the sky.

Over 11,000 alleged victims have reported their experiences to the Church, and more than 4,700 priests since 1950 have been credibly accused of sexually victimizing minors. The Church has paid over one billion dollars to adults who claim to have been sexually abused by priests and there is no end in sight to these lawsuits.<p>Celibacy, homosexuality in the priesthood, the infiltration into the priesthood of secular moral relativism, too much liberalism in the Church since Vatican II, damaging rollback of Vatican II reforms by conservative prelates--all have been suggested as causes for the crisis. This book, however, begins with the premise that, because the pattern of abuse and cover-up was so similar across the world, there is something fundamentally awry with Church traditions and power structures in relationship to sexuality and sexual abuse. </p><p>Specifically, in chapters on suffering and sadomasochism, bodies and gender, desire and sexuality, celibacy and homosexuality, the author concludes that aspects of the Catholic theology of sexuality set the stage for the abuse of minors and its cover-up. Frawley-O'Dea also analyzes the American bishops' lack of pastoral care and tendency towards clerical narcissism--the belief that the needs of the hierarchy represent the needs of the wider Church--as central factors in the scandal. She balances this criticism with a discussion of the backgrounds of the bishops presiding over the crisis and the challenges they faced in their relationships with the Pope and Vatican officials. </p><p>Drawing on twenty years of clinical experience, she imagines the dynamics of sexual abuse both from the victim's point of view and from the priest's, and she probes why the Church hierarchy, fellow priests, and lay people were silent for so long. Finally, Frawley-O'Dea examines factors internal to the Church and outside of it that drew this scandal into the public square and kept it there.</p></p><p>Mary Gail Frawley-O'Dea, a clinical psychologist, was the only mental health professional to address the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops at their seminal 2002 Dallas meeting on the sexual abuse crisis, and she was one of the clinicians speaking about sexual abuse to the Conference of Major Superiors of Men that year.

Be incredible&#34; That&#39;s the advice Teresa Rae Wood gives the listeners of her popular local radio show, Modern Pioneers, and she has taken it to heart in her own life. She fled a bad marriage, escaping to Midden, Minnesota (pop. 408), where she fell in love with a carpenter who became a loving stepfather to her children, Claire and Joshua. Now Claire is away at college, Joshua is laboring through his senior year of high school, and Teresa and Bruce are working to make ends meet. Despite their struggles, their love for each other binds them as a family. Then they receive the devastating news that Teresa has cancer and at thirty-eight may have less than one year to live. Those she will leave behind face something previously unimaginable - a future without her. In Torch, the award-winning writer Cheryl Strayed creates from one family&#39;s shattering experience a novel infused with tenderness, compassion, and beauty.</p><p>CHERYL STRAYED&#39;s award-winning stories and essays have appeared in more than a dozen magazines, including the New York Times Magazine, Allure, Elle, and Nerve.

It was pure white and had a small golden lock that opened with a small golden key that was also meant to re-secure the lock, but never did. I loved that diary. I remember very distinctly knowing it was the best gift I&#x2019;d ever received. I filled it with stories about princesses and kings, about horses ridden by girls whose fathers drove around in fancy cars. I wrote about things that were nothing about me.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I was eleven a poet came to my school to teach a class for several days. She was called a poet-in-the-school, a special guest, a rare occurrence. Every minute she spoke it was like someone was holding a lit match to the most flammable, secret parts of me. One day the poet-in-the-school explained what metaphors were and then asked us to write a whole poem composed of them. I was a lion. I was an icicle. I was a kaleidoscope. I was a torn-up page. I was glass that other people took to be stone. Another day she told us we could write poems about our memories. She asked us to close our eyes and think for a while about when we were younger and then open our eyes and write. I wrote about running down the sidewalk in what I called &#x201c;beautiful, filthy Pittsburgh&#x201d; in my paint-speckled sneakers when I was five.<br> &nbsp;<br> A week later the principal summoned me to his office. When I arrived he explained from behind his big desk that the poet-in-the-school had showed him my poem. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good writer!&#x201d; he exclaimed. His name was Mr. Menzel. He was the first person to ever say this to me. He handed me a copy of my poem and asked if I would read it out loud to him and I did, mortified but also happy. After I was done reading he said it was surprising that I&#x2019;d described Pittsburgh as being beautiful and filthy because most people would think it could not be both things at once. &#x201c;Keep writing, Cheryl,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> I kept writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t know that by doing so I was becoming a writer. I knew people wrote books, but it didn&#x2019;t occur to me that I could be one of them until I was twenty and a junior at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, enrolled in an introductory poetry class taught by Michael Dennis Browne. I learned a lot in that class. I came to understand language in a way I&#x2019;d never understood it. I wrote my first serious (though lousy) poems. But most important, I got to be in a room a few times a week with a writer who&#x2019;d written not just one book, but many, and it was only then that it dawned on me that even though the gap between who he was and who I was seemed enormous, maybe&#x2014;just maybe&#x2014;I could bridge that gap and someday be a person who wrote a book too.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve often been asked how long it took me to write <i>Torch</i>. There are three answers to this question and they are all true: four years, seven years, and thirty-four years. But the last answer is the truest. <i>Torch</i> is born of the little white diary with the lock that wouldn&#x2019;t work, the poet-in-the-school who taught me what a metaphor was, the principal who said keep writing, the writer whose existence showed me the way. They are not in the acknowledgments of this book, but they are in its blood. <i>Torch</i> is the story I had broiling in my bones for the first thirty-four years of my life. It&#x2019;s the story I felt I could not live without telling. The one that made me think I could die when I finished writing it (though I can&#x2019;t and don&#x2019;t want to). Perhaps every writer has this relationship to his or her first book. I worked my tail off when I wrote my other books, Wild and Tiny Beautiful Things, but <i>Torch</i> is the book that taught me how to write a book and because of that it was the one that demanded the deepest faith, the greatest leap, the furthest reach.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Torch</i> is a novel about a family in rural northern Minnesota during a time of great loss. Because I grew up in a place not unlike the place depicted in the novel and because my family experienced a great loss not unlike that of the Wood/Gunther family in the book, many people read <i>Torch</i> as if it&#x2019;s nonfiction, but it is not. Like a lot of novelists, I drew on my life experiences while writing <i>Torch</i>&#x2014;those who&#x2019;ve read my other books will undoubtedly recognize some details about my mother and her death and the general landscape and culture of rural Aitkin County, Minnesota, where I came of age&#x2014;but the autobiographical elements were only the seeds from which I created a fictional world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though it&#x2019;s true my family and I listened to radio shows of the sort Teresa Wood hosts in Torch on the very real community station KAXE, my mother wasn&#x2019;t a radio show host and I can&#x2019;t imagine she&#x2019;d have wanted to be, given the opportunity. My brother didn&#x2019;t go to jail for dealing methamphetamines like Joshua Wood does. My stepfather wasn&#x2019;t an only child who obsessively listened to the music of Kenny G in his grief like Bruce Gunther does. I didn&#x2019;t have an affair while my mother lay dying in a hospital in Duluth like Claire Wood does.<br> &nbsp;<br> In writing <i>Torch</i>, I wanted to tell a story that had no obligation to what actually happened and yet what happened had everything to do with my need to write <i>Torch</i>. One of the great paradoxes of writing fiction is that it&#x2019;s often only through imagination that a writer can reveal the greatest truth. I certainly felt that way as I wrote <i>Torch</i>. I don&#x2019;t know precisely what it meant for my stepfather to lose his wife or for my siblings to lose their mother, but in <i>Torch</i> I tried very hard to know. Fic- tion gave me license to seek. It allowed me to tell the only story I could at the time, one that exceeded the bounds of my own particular grief&#x2014;a grief that was so enormous I couldn&#x2019;t hold it alone. I needed to cast it into other bodies, other minds, and also to pay those other people their due. They had lost my mother too. I put the story of my family&#x2019;s sorrow on a larger, mostly make-believe stage so I could make sense of how any of us had managed to come out the other side. In doing so, my allegiance wasn&#x2019;t accuracy. It was emotional truth.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s what I mean when I tell you that <i>Torch</i> was broiling in my bones. It was the story of my life and yet I made everything up. I created characters, even as I felt the people I knew and loved in every word I wrote. I set the story in a place that both was and was not home. I named the town in <i>Torch</i> Midden&#x2014;the medieval word for a communal garbage heap&#x2014;not because I wanted to imply my beloved hometown of McGregor was a dump, but because a midden is the most valuable find when archeologists do their excavations. It&#x2019;s the place where we recover the hidden treasures, both grand and mundane. In middens, the story of a people and a place can be found, but only if we dig.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Torch</i> is the result of my first sustained effort at digging. When I scratched beneath the surface as I wrote it, I came to understand I didn&#x2019;t know what I was going to find as each layer revealed itself. It was only after I&#x2019;d finished that I could see what I&#x2019;d done: written a novel not only about grief and loss, but also about love in its many forms, about how we find light in the midst of the most profound darkness, about how we survive what we think we will not. And it&#x2019;s only from this vantage point&#x2014;years after <i>Torch</i> was first published&#x2014;that I can see all of my books are about that. How things can be both beautiful and filthy at once.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1</b><br> &nbsp;<br> She ached. As if her spine were a zipper and someone had come up behind her and unzipped it and pushed his hands into her organs and squeezed, as if they were butter or dough, or grapes to be smashed for wine. At other times it was something sharp like diamonds or shards of glass engraving her bones. Teresa explained these sensations to the doctor&#x2014;the zipper, the grapes, the diamonds, and the glass&#x2014; while he sat on his little stool with wheels and wrote in a note- book. He continued to write after she&#x2019;d stopped speaking, his head cocked and still like a dog listening to a sound that was distinct, but far off. It was late afternoon, the end of a long day of tests, and he was the final doctor, the <i>real</i> doctor, the one who would tell her at last what was wrong.<br> &nbsp;<br> Teresa held her earrings in the palm of one hand&#x2014;dried violets pressed between tiny panes of glass&#x2014;and put them on, still getting dressed after hours of going from one room to the next in a hospital gown. She examined her shirt for lint and cat hair, errant pieces of thread, and primly picked them off. She looked at Bruce, who looked out the window at a ship in the harbor, which cut elegantly, tranquilly along the surface of the lake, as if it weren&#x2019;t January, as if it weren&#x2019;t Minnesota, as if it weren&#x2019;t ice.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the moment she wasn&#x2019;t in pain and she told the doctor this while he wrote. &#x201c;There are long stretches of time that I feel perfectly fine,&#x201d; she said, and laughed the way she did with strangers. She confessed that she wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if she were going mad or perhaps this was the beginning of menopause or maybe she had walking pneumonia. Walking pneumonia had been her latest theory, the one she liked best. The one that explained the cough, the ache. The one that could have made her spine into a zipper.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to have one more glance,&#x201d; the doctor said, looking up at her as if he had risen from a trance. He was young. Younger. <i>Was he thirty</i>? she wondered. He instructed her to take her clothes off again and gave her a fresh gown to wear and then left the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> She undressed slowly, tentatively at first, and then quickly, crouching, as if Bruce had never seen her naked. The sun shone into the room and made everything lilac.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The light&#x2014;it&#x2019;s so pretty,&#x201d; she said, and stepped up to sit on the examining table. A rosy slice of her abdomen peeped out from a gap in the gown, and she mended it shut with her hands. She was thirsty but not allowed a drop of water. Hungry, from having not eaten since the night before. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m starving.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; said Bruce. &#x201c;Appetite means that you&#x2019;re healthy.&#x201d; His face was red and dry and cracked-looking, as if he&#x2019;d just come in from plowing the driveway, though he&#x2019;d been with her all day, going from one section of the hospital to the next, reading what he could find in the waiting rooms. Reading <i>Reader&#x2019;s Digest</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> and <i>Self</i> against his will but reading hungrily, avidly, from cover to cover. Throughout the day, in the small spaces of time in which she too had had to wait, he&#x2019;d told her the stories. About an old woman who&#x2019;d been bludgeoned to death by a boy she&#x2019;d hired to build a dog- house. About a movie star who&#x2019;d been forced by divorce to sell his boat. About a man in Kentucky who&#x2019;d run a marathon in spite of the fact that he had only one foot, the other made of metal, a complicated, sturdy coil fitted into a shoe.<br> &nbsp;<br> The doctor knocked, then burst in without waiting for an answer. He washed his hands and brought his little black instrument out, the one with the tiny light, and peered into her eyes, her ears, her mouth. She could smell the cinnamon gum he chewed and also the soap he&#x2019;d used before he touched her. She kept herself from blinking while staring directly into the bullet of light, and then, when he asked, followed his pen expertly around the room using only her eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a sickly woman,&#x201d; she declared.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nobody agreed. Nobody disagreed. But Bruce came to stand behind her and rub her back.<br> &nbsp;<br> His hands made a scraping sound against the fabric of the gown, so rough and thick they were, like tree bark. At night he cut the calluses off with a jackknife.<br> &nbsp;<br> The doctor didn&#x2019;t say cancer&#x2014;at least she didn&#x2019;t hear him say it. She heard him say oranges and peas and radishes and ovaries and lungs and liver. He said tumors were growing like wildfire along her spine.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about my brain?&#x201d; she asked, dry-eyed.<br> &nbsp;<br> He told her he&#x2019;d opted not to check her brain because her ovaries and lungs and liver made her brain irrelevant. &#x201c;Your breasts are fine,&#x201d; he said, leaning against the sink.<br> &nbsp;<br> She blushed to hear that. <i>Your breasts are fine.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said, and leant forward a bit in her chair. Once, she&#x2019;d walked six miles through the streets of Duluth in honor of women whose breasts <i>weren&#x2019;t</i> fine and in return she&#x2019;d received a pink T-shirt and a spaghetti dinner.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What does this mean exactly?&#x201d; Her voice was reasonable beyond reason. She became acutely aware of each muscle in her face. Some were paralyzed, others twitched. She pressed her cold hands against her cheeks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to alarm you,&#x201d; the doctor said, and then, very calmly, he stated that she could not expect to be alive in one year. He talked for a long time in simple terms, but she could not make out what he was saying. When she&#x2019;d first met Bruce, she&#x2019;d asked him to explain to her how, precisely, the engine of a car worked. She did this because she loved him and she wanted to demonstrate her love by taking an interest in his knowledge. He&#x2019;d sketched the parts of an engine on a napkin and told her what fit together and what parts made other parts move and he also took several detours to explain what was likely to be happening when certain things went wrong and the whole while she had smiled and held her face in an expression of simulated intelligence and understanding, though by the end she&#x2019;d learned absolutely nothing. This was like that.<br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t look at Bruce, couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to. She heard a hiccup of a cry from his direction and then a long horrible cough.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said when the doctor was done talking. &#x201c;I mean, for doing everything you can do.&#x201d; And then she added weakly, &#x201c;But. There&#x2019;s one thing&#x2014;are you sure? Because... actually... I don&#x2019;t feel that sick.&#x201d; She felt she&#x2019;d know it if she had oranges growing in her; she&#x2019;d known immediately both times that she&#x2019;d been pregnant.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That will come. I would expect extremely soon,&#x201d; said the doctor. He had a dimpled chin, a baby face. &#x201c;This is a rare situation&#x2014;to find it so late in the game. Actually, the fact that we found it so late speaks to your overall good health. Other than this, you&#x2019;re in excellent shape.&#x201d;<br><br> He hoisted himself up to sit on the counter, his legs dangling and swinging.<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said again, reaching for her coat.</p><h2>Ask Him Why</h2><p><p><b>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Catherine Ryan Hyde comes a stunning, emotional story of a young soldier&#x2019;s unthinkable act...and the unbreakable bonds between a sister and brother.</b></p><p>Ruth and her little brother, Aubrey, are just teenagers when their older brother ships off to Iraq.

She followed this story collection with another, <i>Like Life</i>, as well as two fine novels, <i>Anagrams</i> and <i>Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?</i> Yet Moore's rapid-fire alternation of mirth and deep melancholy is so perfectly suited to the short form that readers will greet <i>Birds of America</i> with an audible sigh of relief--and delight. In "Willing," for example, a second-rate Hollywood starlet retreats into a first-rate depression, taking shelter in a Chicago-area Days Inn. The author's eye for the small comic detail is intact: her juice-bar-loving heroine initially drowns her sorrows in "places called I Love Juicy or Orange-U-Sweet." Yet Moore seldom satisfies herself with mere pop-cultural mockery. She's too interested in the small and large devastations of life, which her actress is experiencing in spades. "Walter leaned her against his parked car," Moore relates. "His mouth was slightly lopsided, paisley-shaped, his lips anneloid and full, and he kissed her hard. There was something numb and on hold in her. There were small dark pits of annihilation she discovered in her heart, in the loosening fist of it, and she threw herself into them, falling." Elsewhere, the author serves up a similar mixture of one-liners and contemporary grief, lamenting the death of a housecat in "Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens" and the death of a marriage in "Which Is More Than I Can Say About That." And her hilarious account of a nuclear family undergoing a meltdown in "Charades" will make you want to avoid parlor games for the rest of your natural life. <i>--James Marcus</i>"Lorrie Moore soars with <i>Birds of America</i>...a marvelous, fiercely funny book." --Jeff Giles, <i>Newsweek</i><p> "Fluid, cracked, mordant, colloquial, Moore's sentences hold, even startle.... Her most potent work so far...[it] will stand by itself as one of our funniest, most telling anatomies of human love and vulnerability." --James McManus, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p> "A marvelous collection, deeper than anything Moore has written and yet underscored by that trademark humor in the face of familiar awfulness. Her stories are tough, lean, funny, and metaphysical.... Birds of America has about it a wild beauty that simply makes one feel more connected to life." --Gail Caldwell, <i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p> "At once sad, funny, lyrical and prickly, <i>Birds of America</i> attests to the deepening emotional chiaroscuro of her wise and beguiling work." --Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i></p></p><h2>The Last London: True Fictions from an Unreal City</h2><p><b>A <i>New Statesman</i> Book of the Year</b><br> <br>London.

He grows up frolicking in the meadow, befriending butterflies and screech owls, and learning about the dark fear of all the woodland creatures: man. Over time, Bambi seeks out the wisdom of the prince of deer, a magnificent old stag who walks alone through the paths of the forest. Bambi is torn between his desire to be with his beloved mate, Faline, and his yearning for the knowledge and solitude the prince represents. He is also conflicted about his friend Gobo, who has returned to the forest after a winter living among humans. Gobo behaves unnaturally by strolling through the woods by day when other deer are sleeping, showing no fear of his natural mortal enemy.<p> This 1926 classic has been stretched and squeezed into many forms over the years, but the Felix Salten original should not be missed. With the richer, more highly wrought language of his time, Salten crafts a story layered in meaning, weighty with its message.

Between the disagreeable boy and the literary lion, a life unfolds, full of comedy and drama, as told in this definitive biography, which brings together two exemplary American men of letters.<p>Born within a dozen years of one another in small towns in Utah, both men were, as Stegner writes, "novelists by intention, teachers by necessity, and historians by the sheer compulsion of the region that shaped us". From this unique vantage point, Stegner follows DeVoto's path from his beloved but not particularly congenial Utah to the even less congenial Harvard where, galvanized by the disregard of the aesthetes around him, he commenced a career that, over three and a half decades, would embrace nearly every sort of literary enterprise: from modestly successful novels to prize-winning Western histories, from the editorship of the Saturday Review to a famously combative, long-running monthly column in Harper's, "The Easy Chair". A nuanced portrait of a stormy literary life, Stegner's biography of DeVoto is also a window on the tumultuous world of American letters in the twentieth century.</p>"Stegner's 'valentine' to his friend . . . captures the times in which he thrived&#x2014;it's a remarkable look at the literary politics of an era, and a man who found himself at its red-hot center."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>"One of the best-written biographies . . .

This rare opportunity took the famous travelers not only to Moscow and Stalingrad -- now Volgograd -- but through the countryside of the Ukraine and the Caucasus. Hailed by the New York Times as "superb" when it first appeared in 1948, A Russian Journal is the distillation of their journey and remains a remarkable memoir and unique historical document.</p><p>What they saw and movingly recorded in words and on film was what Steinbeck called "the great other side there ... [the] private life of the Russian people". Unlike other Western reporting about Russia at the time, A Russian Journal is free of ideological obsessions. Rather, Steinbeck and Capa recorded the grim realities of factory workers, government clerks, and peasants, as they emerged from the rubble of World War II. Through it all, we are given intimate glimpses of two artists at the height of their powers, answering their need to document human struggle.</p><b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br> &nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br> &nbsp;<br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B.

In <i>Emotions Revealed</i>, he assembles his research and theories to provide a comprehensive look at the evolutionary roots of human emotions, including anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and happiness. <br><br>Drawing on decades of fieldwork, Ekman shows that emotions are deeply embedded in the human species. In the process, he answers such questions as: What triggers emotions and can we stop them? How does our body signal to others whether we are slightly sad or anguished, peeved or enraged? Can we learn to distinguish between a polite smile and the genuine thing? Can we ever truly control our emotions? Unique exercises and photographs help readers identify emotions in themselves and others. <br><br><i>Emotions Revealed</i> is a practical, mind-opening, and potentially life-changing exploration of science and self.<br> c<br></p><p>Paul Ekman is the&nbsp;world&#x2019;s foremost expert on facial expressions and the professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California Medical School in San Francisco. He has served as an adviser to police departments, antiterrorism groups, and animation studios, and&nbsp;Ekman&#x2019;s research inspired <i>Lie to Me,</i> the FOX TV series<i>. </i>The author of fifteen books, he lives in northern California.<br>Chelsea Thomas was born with M�bius syndrome, in which a nerve that transmits commands from the brain to the facial muscles is missing. As a result, for her first seven years Chelsea looked perpetually grumpy. Then surgeons transplanted nerves from Chelsea's leg to both sides of her mouth, and today Chelsea can do what most people in the world take for granted. She can smile. Meanwhile, thousands of adults are botoxing the nerves that allow them to frown. Actors who do so cannot convey anger or fear, and some botoxed mothers complain that their children no longer take their admonitions seriously, accompanied as they are by the mothers' bland expressions. Paul Ekman would not be surprised. He has been studying facial expression of emotions for some 30 years, in the noble tradition of Aristotle, who first observed the characteristic facial expressions of anger, fear "and all the other passions," and Charles Darwin, who added an evolutionary explanation. Darwin's theory of the universality of emotional expression was unpopular in the 1960s, when Ekman began his research. It was the era of the tabula rasa in social science; Ekman was to emotion what Harry Harlow was to love, swimming against the academic tides. As a graduate student at the time, I was in that tide up to my neck, and I remember how vehemently psychologists protested the idea that any aspect of human behavior might have a hardwired element. Facial expressions? Clearly cultural. Don't the Japanese coolly suppress any sign of emotion, and don't the Italians exuberantly reveal theirs? Over the next decades, Ekman and his colleagues gathered evidence of the universality of seven facial expressions of emotion: anger, happiness, fear, surprise, disgust, sadness and contempt. In every culture they studied--in Japan, throughout Europe and the U.S., and among the nonliterate Fore of New Guinea--a large majority could recognize the basic emotional expressions portrayed by people in other cultures, and others could recognize theirs. Yet, as Ekman also showed, cultures do differ widely in the "display rules" of emotional expression. Certain emotions are universal, hardwired into facial expressions and the brain; however, emotional expressions are culture-specific. People smile or display anger for many reasons, and they don't reveal these emotions when such displays would be considered rude or inappropriate. Ekman and his collaborator Wallace Friesen created a coding system that identifies each of the nearly 80 muscles of the face, as well as the thousands of combinations of muscles associated with various emotions. (Ekman can do all of them himself.) When people try to hide their feelings or "put on" an emotion, Ekman found, they use different groups of muscles than they do for authentic feelings. For example, authentic smiles of joy involve the muscles surrounding the eyes; false or social smiles bypass the eyes completely. In Emotions Revealed, Ekman, who is a professor of psychology at the University of California at San Francisco, beautifully interweaves his research with anecdotes, recommendations, and the behind-the-scenes flubs, accidental discoveries and debates that never make their way into published articles but that are the essence of scientific inquiry. He reviews what is known about the triggers, automatic and learned, that set off an emotion and how we might learn to manage or even get rid of them. He then examines five emotions in detail: sadness, anger, fear, disgust and contempt, and the "enjoyable emotions." I was charmed to find naches on the list (the Yiddish word--it rhymes with "Loch Ness"--for the pleasure and pride that "parents feel when their child accomplishes something important"), along with "wonder," defined in terms of "its rarity and the feeling of being overwhelmed by something incomprehensible." Because of Ekman's emphasis on the universality of emotions, especially those written on the face, readers will not learn much about the raging debate about emotions that do not necessarily have particular facial expressions, such as pride, envy, jealousy, compassion, and romantic or parental love (Ekman does not consider these to be "emotions," although other researchers do). Nor will readers learn much about the origins of emotion blends (such as naches, wonder, longing, the feeling of "bittersweet," and schadenfreude), which are more varied across cultures and individuals and which appear to be uniquely human, involving as they do higher cognitive processes. Readers will enjoy seeing the many facial expressions of Ekman's favorite photographic subject, his daughter, Eve, who must have received ample compensation in fatherly naches for her ability to isolate and vary her facial muscles to reveal each basic emotion. These photographs serve brilliantly for scientific research, but whether they will help readers become better at accurately detecting another's emotion is doubtful. As research by others in this field has shown, when we read another's emotion, we do so through the filters and blinders of culture, the immediate situation, status, our own history, and degree of familiarity with the target. The face reveals, and the face lies. And as Ekman himself once observed, we wouldn't want it otherwise. <p><i>Carol Tavris, a social psychologist, is author of Anger: The Misunderstood Emotion (Touchstone Books, 1989).</i></p></p><h2>The Four Ingredient Cookbook Holidays &amp; Celebrations</h2><p>Entertaining does not have to be complicated!

It demystifies the subject of natural or bioidentical hormone therapy and debunks the myth that menopause is the primary trigger of midlife symptoms such as constant fatigue, lack of zest, sleep difficulties, mood swings, weight gain, loss of sex drive, forgetfulness, fuzzy thinking, and even hot flashes. In a friendly style, the book reveals the chief lifestyle triggers of hormonal havoc that are ignored in health care today; why six key hormones&#x2014;insulin, cortisol, thyroid, estrogen, progesterone and testosterone&#x2014;must be in balance; how to restore harmony by making practical lifestyle changes that cost little or nothing; and when necessary, how to get medical help. While aimed mainly at women, Hormone Harmony includes a chapter and plan for men.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Alicia Stanton is one of the country's leading experts on hormone therapy.

Most importantly, it provides a road map for women seeking to create hormone balance, providing a checklist of symptoms for identifying imbalances.&nbsp;The authors possess high-level credentials: Alicia Stanton, M.D., is a specialist in preventative medicine and hormone imbalance, and serves as chief medical officer of BodyLogicMD, a network of physicians specializing in bioidentical hormone therapy. Co-author Vera Tweed, a veteran health writer, has written several books and is a contributing editor for Better Nutrition and other magazines.&nbsp;What makes them both well-suited to pen such a comprehensive guide, though, isn&#x2019;t just their experience in the medical field, but their personal journeys with hormones. Each shares the story of a dramatic medical event and how these health setbacks brought them to examine bioidentical hormones more closely. Stanton&#x2019;s story begins with a heart-rending anecdote about waking up after back surgery, wondering if she&#x2019;d live long enough to see her little son get his first grown-up haircut.&nbsp;Hormone imbalance can be tricky to spot, they note, because the situation brings on multiple symptoms like sleep disturbance, weight gain, mood swings, and low energy. Although menopause is traditionally seen as the chief culprit for unbalanced hormone levels, Stanton and Tweed believe that imbalance can happen at any stage of life and can significantly impact a woman&#x2019;s quality of life.&nbsp;With diligence and wonderfully clear writing, the pair detail how hormones work, explaining issues like cortisol triggers and insulin resistance. That same straightforward, informative tone allows them to discuss other subjects like carbohydrates, strength-training, and antibacterial products.&nbsp;The authors posit that healthy lifestyle changes and bioidentical hormones can restore balance, and their descriptions of even this medical terminology are clear: &#x201c;To get an idea of the difference between hormones that are bioidentical and those that are not, imagine a jigsaw puzzle,&#x201d; they write. &#x201c;In a normal puzzle, the pieces will fit if you put them in the right places. That&#x2019;s how bioidentical hormones work in our bodies; they fit.&#x201d;&nbsp;The book isn&#x2019;t about popping pills to feel healthy, though; the authors delve deep into crucial topics like diet improvement, physical exercise, toxins, supplements, and stress. Each of these areas has an effect on how the body produces hormones, and how those hormones interact. Although the work is primarily addressed to women, they include a chapter for men, with the same type of lucid, solid suggestions for health.&nbsp;Both bioidentical hormones and lifestyle shifts are complex areas, making this easy-to-digest guide particularly invaluable.&nbsp;Elizabeth Millard ForeWord Clarion Reviews</p><h2>The Alice Network</h2><p>The Alice Network</p><p><p><em>1947</em>.

Smith's engaging and, at times, heartbreaking account is an essential record of that loss.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Former People</i> is ultimately an incredibly readable, vivid, emotional human story of survival, accommodation, and reconciliation.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sean Guillory, New Books Network</i></p><p>&#x201c;Engrossing . . . with richly detailed event and anecdote.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Liesl Schillinger, The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;An engaging and absorbing book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jennifer Siegel, The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;A remarkable, deeply affecting book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Walton, GuideLive</i></p><p>&#x201c;Smith examines the much-neglected 'fate of the nobility in the decades following the Russian Revolution,' when they were sometimes given the Orwellian title 'former people.' The author of several books on Russia (<i>The Pearl</i>; <i>Working the Rough Stone</i>), Smith focuses on three generations of two families: the Sheremetsevs of St. Petersburg and the Golitsyns of Moscow. He begins by showing their extravagant wealth before the revolution; in the late 19th century, Count Dmitri Sheremetsev owned 1.9 million acres worked by 300,000 serfs. From the 1917 Bolshevik revolution until Stalin's death in 1953, these families and others suffered, at best, severe persecution and impoverishment; at worst, murder by mobs or the secret police, or a slow death in the gulag. In his sprawling but well-paced narrative, Smith tells many memorable stories, including one of Vladimir Golitsyn's son-in-law, who hid the fact that he'd been sentenced to death from his wife, who'd been allowed a three-day visit. Smith also provides fascinating background information, such as the Bolsheviks' jaundiced view of 'decadent' Western culture. Maxim Gorky said the foxtrot, popular among nobles during the 1920s and early '30s, 'fostered moral degeneracy and led inexorably to homosexuality.' This is an anecdotally rich, highly informative look at decimated, uprooted former upper-class Russians.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;When the Bolshevik Revolution came in 1917, the new order began transforming aristocrats into paupers, exiles and corpses&#x2015;a transformation that consumed decades. Smith, a former U.S. diplomat and authority on the Soviets and author of several previous works (The Pearl: A Tale of Forbidden Love in Catherine the Great&#x2019;s Russia, 2008, etc.), takes a different approach to revolutionary history, focusing on the fallen class: Who were they? What had their lives been like? What happened to them? The author follows two aristocratic families (later, they intermarried), the Sheremetevs and the Golitsyns, showing the splendor in which they lived and then the squalor into which they declined. The author is deeply sympathetic to their fates. Although he states that the aristocracy had, of course, flourished on the servitude of others, he tells such wrenching, emotional stories about his characters that it&#x2019;s easy to forget who once wore the silken slippers. Smith&#x2019;s research is remarkably thorough in its range and detail, so much so that readers may feel overwhelmed by such powerful surges of suffering. Searches, arrests, firings, confiscations of property, internal exile, imprisonments, tortures, executions, desecration of graves&#x2015;these and other grim experiences Smith chronicles in his compelling narrative. He mentions significant historical events, but his intent is to show how these events affected his characters. He portrays with brutal clarity the truth of Orwell&#x2019;s Animal Farm: A new aristocracy&#x2015;a political one&#x2015;emerged to enjoy the benefits of living on the labor of others.</p><p>Sobering stories about the politics of power&#x2015;its loss, its gain&#x2015;and the deep human suffering that inevitably results.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sobering stories about the politics of power--its loss, its gain--and the deep human suffering that inevitably results.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Absolutely gripping, brilliantly researched, with a cast of flamboyant Russian princesses and princes from the two greatest noble dynasties and brutal Soviet commissars, <i>The Former People</i> is an important history book--but it's really the heartbreaking human story of the splendors and death of the Russian aristocracy and the survival of its members as individuals.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Simon Sebag Montefiore, author of Jerusalem and Catherine the Great and Potemkin</i></p><p>&#x201c;Douglas Smith's <i>Former People</i> is a passionate and vivid story of the destruction of an entire class--the Russian aristocracy--during the Bolshevik Revolution. What the Communists began with the nobility, they were to continue with writers, poets, artists, peasants, and workers.

Daniel J. Brown recounts the events surrounding the fire in the first and only book on to chronicle the dramatic story that unfolded. Whereas Oregon's famous "Biscuit" fire in 2002 burned 350,000 acres in one week, the Hinckley fire did the same damage in five hours. The fire created its own weather, including hurricane-strength winds, bubbles of plasma-like glowing gas, and 200-foot-tall flames. In some instances, "fire whirls," or tornadoes of fire, danced out from the main body of the fire to knock down buildings and carry flaming debris into the sky. Temperatures reached 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit--the melting point of steel. As the fire surrounded the town, two railroads became the only means of escape. Two trains ran the gauntlet of fire. One train caught on fire from one end to the other. The heroic young African-American porter ran up and down the length of the train, reassuring the passengers even as the flames tore at their clothes. On the other train, the engineer refused to back his locomotive out of town until the last possible minute of escape.

During that time, he has recorded nearly 90 albums, won seven Grammys, and earned lifetime achievement awards from the Black Theatre Workshop, the Peabody Conservatory of Music, and the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences. He has played with, and come to know, many of the genre's greatest contributors, including Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington. Peterson chronicles his storied career in A Jazz Odyssey: The Life of Oscar Peterson.Organized chronologically, A Jazz Odyssey takes readers through the development of jazz over the course of the late 20th century as seen by one of the jazz world's most celebrated figures. Peterson guides readers through the turbulent 1940s, when he was playing with the Johnny Holmes Orchestra in Montreal, and first met Norman Granz - the jazz producer who would launch his career. With Granz, he joined Jazz at the Philharmonic, playing at Carnegie Hall and touring all over North America. A Jazz Odyssey also brings readers to the birth of the Oscar Peterson Trio - where Peterson would hone his trademark arrangement of piano, guitar, and bass and work with the likes of Ray Brown, Barney Kessel, and Herb Ellis. Peterson describes the endless practice sessions and tireless work ethic that earned the group the reputation of the hardest working trio in the business. He also describes meeting his idol Art Tatum during the 1950s and touring with him in Jazz at the Philharmonic.A Jazz Odyssey explores the process behind cutting the dozens of albums that the Oscar Peterson Trio cut during the 1950s. The trio's incarnation at that time included Peterson, himself, in addition to Herb Ellis and Ray Brown - a group that would become known as one of the greatest jazz combinations of the time. Peterson calls the 1960s "years of unbelievable music," as Ellis's retirement brought the renowned Ed Thigpen into the trio. During the 1960s, Peterson also opened the Advanced School of Contemporary Music in Toronto, Ontario, and released his first major composition, "Canadian Suite." A Jazz Odyssey delves into Peterson's relationship with German millionaire and jazz fanatic Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer, a friendship which Peterson credits with helping him create some of his best recordings ever. A Jazz Odyssey looks at the new incarnations of the Oscar Peterson Trio during the 1970s, but also examines the great deal of philanthropic work Peterson did for the nation of Canada. Over time, he would be recognized as an outstanding advocate for Canadian culture, eventually winning the title of Officer of the Order of Canada from the national government. Oscar discusses his experiences through the 1980s and 90s, the period when he turned more toward composing than performing, and saw one of his goals come to fruition with the performance of his "Easter Suite" composition. Peterson speaks candidly about his personal life throughout A Jazz Odyssey - giving readers a rare look at the private life of the jazz star. He discusses meeting his wife early on in his career and the role that she played in his work. He also recalls the debilitating arthritis he dealt with throughout the 80s and 90s - the condition that would prevent him from going out on the road, even though touring had been his whole life up until then. With the humor and energy that has characterized his personality throughout his brilliant career, Peterson also talks about his life after his stroke in the mid-1990s.In 1997 Oscar Peterson received a Grammy for Lifetime Achievement and an International Jazz Hall of Fame Award, proof that he is still regarded as one of the greatest jazz musicians ever to play. A Jazz Odyssey is a revealing, fascinating look inside the career and life of a jazz world luminary.</p><p>Jazz pianist Oscar Peterson is, in the words of Quincy Jones, &#34;one of the greatest musicians on the planet.&#34;Richard Palmer writes regularly for Jazz Journal International and is series editor for Eastnote, Hull University Press&#39;s new imprint of jazz studies.

A New York lawyer, born in 1745, Jay served his country with the greatest distinction and was one of the most influential of its Founding Fathers. In the first full-length biography in almost seventy years, Walter Stahr brings Jay vividly to life, setting his astonishing career against the background of the American Revolution. <p>Drawing on substantial new material, Walter Stahr has written a full and highly readable portrait of both the public and private man. It is the story not only of John Jay himself, the most prominent native-born New Yorker of the eighteenth century, but also of his engaging and intelligent wife, Sarah, who accompanied her husband on his wartime diplomatic missions. This lively and compelling biography presents Jay in the light he deserves: as a major Founding Father, a true national hero, and a leading architect of America's future. </p></p><p>The first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as well as President of the Continental Congress, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and one time Governor of New York, John Jay was a Founding Father of paramount importance to the early Republic and did much to influence the shape of America&#39;s future. Walter Stahr&#39;s lively and engaging narrative illuminates the great life of an American soldier, politician, diplomat and lawyer. Readers will follow Jay&#39;s story through key events in early American history, such as the Revolutionary War, the writing of the Constitution, the first presidencies of the country, and the creation of our most authoritative legal body, the US Supreme Court. Now, Stahr presents Jay in the light he deserves: a Founding Father, a true national hero, and an architect of America&#39;s future."Walter Stahr has not only given us a meticulous study of the life of John Jay, but one very much written in the spirit of the man. It is thorough, fair, and consistently intelligent and presented with the most scrupulous accuracy." --Ron Chernow, author of Alexander Hamilton <p>"John Jay was a brilliant and fascinating statesman who, along with his friend Benjamin Franklin, helped define the values of American diplomacy. Walter Stahr writes with great insight, and this wonderful book should help restore Jay's place in the pantheon of our great Founding Fathers." -- Walter Isaacson, author of Benjamin Franklin: An American Life </p><p>"John Jay, the Founding Father most ignored by historians, has long awaited a good biography. Here it is! Jay played salient roles in many crucial aspects of the founding of the nation. He served in the Continental Congress, held diplomatic posts, played a vital role in the ratification of the Constitution, sat on the Supreme Court, and was governor of New York during the intensely partisan 1790s. Now, at last, a fine biography of this exceptional man is available. Walter Stahr has written a sensitive, illuminating, and provocative life history of Jay that will be welcomed by all who are interested in the American Revolution and the establishment of the Republic." --John Ferling, author of A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic and Adams Verses Jefferson: The Election of 1800 </p><p>"The Federalists built the foundation of our modern American government, and no Federalist leader better exemplifies their vision for a soon-to-be vast and great nation than John Jay. Co-author of the Federalist Papers, President of the Continental Congress, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Chief Justice, Governor: this towering figure of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches made an amazing and indelible imprint on a nation destined to become the world's sole superpower. Walter Stahr's engrossing biography captures as no other book the complex character and profound thought of this influential American Founder, in the process helping us understand how a 55-year-old Governor of New York could decide to retire permanently from public life -- by rejecting the President's nomination, and the Senate's vote of ratification, that would have made him once again Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court." -- U.S. Rep.

From 1927 to &#x2019;33, he wrote and presented something in the region of eighty broadcasts using the new medium of radio. <i>Radio Benjamin</i> gathers the surviving transcripts, which appear here for the first time in English. This eclectic collection demonstrates the range of Benjamin&#x2019;s thinking and his enthusiasm for popular sensibilities. His celebrated &#x201c;Enlightenment for Children&#x201d; youth programs, his plays, readings, book reviews, and fiction reveal Benjamin in a creative, rather than critical, mode.

He is a regular contributor to <i> Artists and Illustrators Magazine </i>and is co-editor of the graphic arts magazine <i> Line. </i> Martin lives in Cambridgeshire, England.</li>The chapters of this richly illustrated book touch on everything from media, materials, and techniques to design and typography, but the information given is not enough to actually teach the subject. Instead, the author gives readers a brief but interesting overview. For instance, in the chapter entitled "Character Development," Salisbury discusses mannerisms, facial expressions, and child-friendliness of characters, but doesn't tell readers how to actually create these effects on their own. However, this book does a very good job of addressing the many elements of illustration for someone who is unfamiliar with the process. Topics such as "What to illustrate," "Dynamics of composition and layout," and "Type as image" give a more concrete concept of the profession and artistry. The featured artwork is all pulled from children's picture books to demonstrate the concepts in the related text. Some are spot illustrations, a character or scene cut from its background, while others are spreads reduced to fit within the page with accompanying text. Colorful and lively, the illustrative material is indispensable to the content. A fine choice for adults interested in illustration, or as a resource for someone new to discussing art in children's books.<i> - Heather E.

Professor Paulie Panther&#x2013;botanist, writer, and hopeless romantic&#x2013;arrives in the experimental forest town of Boney Borough to research a strange plant growing behind the high school. As he conducts his research, he befriends some of the local residents: Miss Jem, the alluring science teacher; Billy Borg, Boney Borough&#x2019;s star athlete; and Pearl Peach, the rebellious schoolgirl. Paulie soon discovers that the plant, when smoked, imparts telepathic powers. But when he shares this remarkable drug with his new friends, he finds that they&#x2019;re not interested in mind-expansion. In fact, it appears that Paulie&#x2019;s brash individualism might not be at all welcome in a town that prefers conformity to eccentricity. <br><br>Nominated for a 2009 Eisner Award and with a bold, innovative design, <i>BodyWorld </i>is a mind-blowing blend of science-fiction, classic high school drama, and futuristic what-if. It is at once funny and fearless&#x2013;and sure to be the graphic novel event of the year.</p><p><strong>Questions for Dash Shaw on <em>Bodyworld</em></strong> <p> </p> <p><b>Q:</b> <em>Bodyworld</em> is about people who smoke a mysterious plant and can then read and feel each others&#x2019; thoughts. Where did you dream up that concept? Was there one event in particular that inspired it?<br> <b>A:</b> When I was in college I was really into figure drawing, and kept being involved in it after I graduated. When you&#x2019;re drawing someone, part of it is imagining what it&#x2019;s like to be inside of the person. You imagine yourself in their body, or look for a psychology in the kinds of poses they make or their face. I was also thinking about how to express how people think in comics, in ways outside of the normal thought balloons (which are just words). If you&#x2019;re doing a book about telepathy, you&#x2019;re really doing a book about how people think, and what it&#x2019;s like to be inside of another person. So of course that leads to a strange, confusing, and funny, often goofy, story.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Which character from <em>Bodyworld</em> was your favorite to dream up? Are any of them based on people in your life?<br> <b>A:</b> The main character, Paulie Panther, was the most fun for me. I think that shows on the page, especially during his interactions with some of the other characters, like Billy Borg. I can&#x2019;t say that anyone was based on a specific, real person. The characters in <em>Bodyworld</em> are very stylized, cartoony, and unrealistic. I think they come more from my sense of humor than anything else.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Which step (pencils, colors, etc.) is your favorite part of the drawing process?<br> <b>A:</b> For <em>Bodyworld</em>, it was the colors. I had done a lot of color comics before <em>Bodyworld</em>, but they were printed in grays because I didn&#x2019;t know what I was doing. Color really freed me up. It was very playful. I work more unself-consciously in color, probably because for many years I was only interested in line drawing and black-and-white comics. It started to feel like my drawings were just an amalgamation of other people&#x2019;s drawings, how someone else drew a hand or tree, but I didn&#x2019;t have that baggage with color. The colors then helped my drawing, too. It&#x2019;s hard to separate the different steps in <em>Bodyworld</em>, since all of the stages were integrated. It wasn&#x2019;t like I did all of the drawings and then colored it. A lot of the pages moved back and forth between the drawing and the coloring stages. Because I don&#x2019;t work inside of a system where I have to submit pencils, or ink a drawing and then color it--since I do everything--it allows me not to separate the stages in my mind.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> When did you know that cartooning was something you wanted to do full-time?<br> <b>A:</b> I always wanted to be a cartoonist, and have been doing comics all of my life. I&#x2019;ve had a lot of friends who wanted to be cartoonists in high school and then stopped in college, and others who stopped after college. A lot of super-talented people stop. It&#x2019;s a tragedy. I don&#x2019;t know why I haven&#x2019;t quit, but I think it&#x2019;s because I enjoy it so much, while to others the cartooning process seems to be painful. It&#x2019;s still fun for me. Comics aren&#x2019;t something that you should want to procrastinate from doing, and they&#x2019;re more fun to make than they are to read. It&#x2019;s like a noncompetitive nonspectator sport. You have to keep at it; otherwise you get out of practice.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> David Mazzucchelli has called you "the future of comics." Where do you see comics heading in the future?<br> <b>A:</b> Right now in bookstores, all of the comics are grouped together: the reprints are right next to the contemporary comics, next to Marvel and DC, next to a nonfiction comic, etc. It&#x2019;s as if you went into the book store and everything, all of it, was organized alphabetically. So I think what&#x2019;ll happen in comics is that it&#x2019;ll become more like other books, in that a Web cartoonist doesn&#x2019;t necessarily read print comics, in the same way that some romance author doesn&#x2019;t necessarily read the latest science fiction works. That&#x2019;s already happening. But that&#x2019;s unusual in comics. It&#x2019;s usually been a small community. But, at the same time, I think there will be people who are viewing everything as a whole. So someone will like Robert Crumb, Otto Soglow, and Suehiro Maruo and then make comics that they&#x2019;d want to read.

For a few seconds he listened to Don Gabbard&#x2019;s verbal report over his PID&#x2019;s wireless earpiece&#x2014;then coasted the machine to a halt, dismounted, and walked across the room to a wall-mounted plastic panel displaying a digital photo of the Newman family assembled in front of a Christmas tree. The general touched the picture with his right index finger. Instantly the family photo disappeared, replaced by the live image of his former ops chief.<br> <br>In the CSG Ops Center, Gabbard could now see and hear his former commander, the high-def sound and image transmitted by tiny visual and acoustic sensors invisibly embedded in the flat plastic panel. Perspiration was running down the general&#x2019;s face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you for the heads-up, Don,&#x201d; said the general in his sweat-soaked T-shirt when Gabbard finished. &#x201c;I can access Dr. Cohen&#x2019;s file here. Keep me posted on what&#x2019;s happening in Houston.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, aye, sir,&#x201d; Gabbard replied. He then asked, &#x201c;Is there anyone else you want me to notify?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not now,&#x201d; Newman answered. &#x201c;Keep an ear on the Gateway link and send me the feed right away if they find Dr. Cohen, ID the perpetrators, or if anything else happens somewhere else in the world on this awful anniversary. I will talk to James about this and one of us will get back to you once we see where this is going. Thank you, Don.&#x201d; With that he pointed his PID at the screen and it instantly reverted to the family Christmas scene.<br> <br>Newman walked to the door of the little gym, waved a hand at a wall-mounted sensor to shut off the lights, and tapped the miniature screen on his PID to lock the door as he strode toward the main house. The sun had already crested the Blue Ridge and the late summer day was becoming warm and humid. He stopped at the gate as the two Dobermans came trotting up to meet him. When they caught his scent&#x2014;or recognized him by sight, he could never tell which&#x2014;both dogs just turned and ambled back to the house.<br> <br>As he reached the porch steps, he again used the PID to unlock the back door, then said to the device, &#x201c;Call James.&#x201d; In the invisible earpiece the general heard the ringtone twice and then a younger version of his own voice: &#x201c;Good morning, Dad. Why aren&#x2019;t you working out?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good morning to you, James,&#x201d; the general responded. &#x201c;If it makes you feel any better, I just finished. What are you doing for breakfast?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mmm, breakfast&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; came the muffled response. In the background there were several thumps and then squeals. &#x201c;If it makes any difference&#x201d;&#x2014;thump&#x2014;&#x201c;I just got back from a run&#x201d;&#x2014;thump&#x2014;&#x201c;and I am in the midst of a pillow fight with two boys who don&#x2019;t want to get up and face the day&#x201d;&#x2014;thump. &#x201c;They are saying something about it being Saturday and they need to sleep in.&#x201d; Thump.<br> <br>Despite the gravity of the news he had just received from Don Gabbard, the old general couldn&#x2019;t help but smile as he listened to the mayhem occurring a mile up the mountain to the east. After a moment he said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to spoil the fun, but after you finish pummeling your pups and take a shower, come on down to the house and have a bowl of cereal with me. Something has come up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I may have to bring some lounge hounds with me,&#x201d; came the answer&#x2014;and another thump. &#x201c;Is seven fifteen soon enough?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. Bring &#x2019;em along. We&#x2019;ll put &#x2019;em on a punishment detail, cutting hay with dull scissors and mucking out every stall on the farm with dinner forks.&#x201d;<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Peter Newman and his wife, Rachel, simply called it &#x201c;the farm.&#x201d; But their children, James and Elizabeth, began calling it &#x201c;Narnia&#x201d; when they were still young&#x2014;after they read C. S. Lewis&#x2019;s Chronicles of Narnia. Every bedroom had a wardrobe. There was a lamppost&#x2014;plenty of furry animals&#x2014;even a stone lion. The Narnia name stuck.<br> <br>Tucked into a fold of the Blue Ridge Mountains and bounded by the Shenandoah River to the west, the Appalachian Trail to the east, and hardwood forests north and south, the farm had been in Rachel&#x2019;s family for generations. The original house, a log cabin, was built in the early 1790s by a veteran of the Revolutionary War.<br> <br>When her mother died in the spring of 2002 and then her father later that same year, Rachel inherited all her parents&#x2019; property: Narnia, another farm near Charlottesville, and two &#x201c;vacation&#x201d; houses&#x2014;one on Boot Key in Florida and another at Pawleys Island, South Carolina.<br> <br>In 2008, after Peter was promoted to major general and assigned to the Marine Corps Combat Training Command at Quantico, Virginia, Rachel sold the places in Florida and Charlottesville. Her timing was impeccable. Just months after the sales closed, the real estate bubble burst and the American economy began a precipitous decline.<br> <br>By the time the Great Recession hit hard, Rachel had renovated the old house at Narnia, turning it into a comfortable home for her family. She built a stable, where she kept four horses and boarded four more, started raising organic beef for sale in local markets, and planted a twelve-acre organic vegetable garden. Until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of &#x201c;nonregistered food products,&#x201d; she was well on her way to keeping her vow of &#x201c;making this place pay for itself.&#x201d;<br> <br>At Pawleys, Rachel invested much of her remaining inheritance to convert the beachfront cottage where she spent so many childhood summers into a year-round home on the north end of the barrier island. The children named it &#x201c;Cair Paravel,&#x201d; another of C. S. Lewis&#x2019;s mythical places. Rachel said at the time she hoped Peter would retire from the Marines and they could live out their years in quiet contentment between Narnia in the Blue Ridge Mountains and Cair Paravel on the Atlantic Ocean. She got half her wish.<br> <br>In May 2011, the Marines tried to make Peter Newman the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans&#x2014;and give him his third star. He was duly nominated for lieutenant general but the Senate Armed Services Committee refused to confirm the appointment. The Secretary of the Navy called him to give him the news. On 7 June 2011, at the age of fifty-five&#x2014;exactly thirty-three years after he accepted his commission as a second lieutenant of Marines at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis&#x2014;Major General Peter Newman, USMC, &#x201c;entered the retired lists.&#x201d;<br> <br>For nearly two years he puttered about between Pawleys Island and the farm, pretending to write his memoirs, painting shutters, fishing in &#x201c;the creek&#x201d; behind Cair Paravel, bird hunting in the Carolina low country&#x2014;and occasionally heading out into the Gulf Stream for some &#x201c;deepwater&#x201d; game fish. At Narnia he planted and harvested crops, pruned the fruit trees, took cows to livestock sales, cut miles of oak fence boards and locust posts on their sawmill, and built run-in sheds for the horses using poplar boards from trees harvested and milled on the farm. He hunted the west slopes of the Blue Ridge, fished the Shenandoah, drove James and Elizabeth to sporting events&#x2014;and drove Rachel crazy inspecting for &#x201c;dust bunnies&#x201d; under the furniture.<br> <br>Friends urged him to run for political office. He turned them down, saying, &#x201c;No thanks. I remember what happened to Oliver North when he tried that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then, on the morning of 2 April 2013, an unusually damp, cold Tuesday, just minutes after Rachel told him, &#x201c;Peter, you are going to drive me crazy if you don&#x2019;t get on with something other than hanging around here!&#x201d; he received a call from Henry Hodson, a federal judge in Richmond, Virginia.<br> <br>In the 1990s, the Newmans and the Hodsons were neighbors in Falls Church, Virginia. Then, Henry was an up-and-coming assistant U.S. attorney and Peter was a major in the Marines. In the years since, Hodson went on to head the U.S. Marshals Service, then to an appointment on the federal bench while Newman conducted &#x201c;special operations&#x201d; in the Corps. They had a lot in common, stayed in touch, and occasionally hunted together. Both men were members of the National Rifle Association, until the organization was banned as an &#x201c;illegal extremist entity&#x201d; for advocating that American citizens violate the United Nations Treaties on Small Arms and Arms Trade by refusing to register privately owned firearms.<br> <br>&#x201c;Peter,&#x201d; the judge said when Newman answered the phone, &#x201c;I have a deal for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, what&#x2019;s that, your honor? Is this a belated April Fool&#x2019;s joke? Can I cop a plea for a lighter sentence?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is no joke,&#x201d; Hodson answered. &#x201c;As you probably know,&#x201d; the judge continued, &#x201c;in order to comply with the UN Convention on Small Arms Control and the International Arms Trade Treaty, Congress, in its infinite wisdom, has made it illegal for U.S. corporations to do any business outside the U.S. that involves the use of firearms.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How is that a &#x2018;deal&#x2019; for me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting to that,&#x201d; Hodson said affably. &#x201c;And General, just in case no one has ever told you before, patience is not your strong suit. That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re such a lousy turkey hunter.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter smiled and replied, &#x201c;Okay, your honor, I&#x2019;m listening.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hodson continued, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just been handed the Chapter Eleven bankruptcy cases for three of the private security companies put out of business by the new law&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought bankruptcies were handled by some administrative court. How come you have this kind of case? Did &#x2018;Hang &#x2019;em High Henry&#x2019; get booted off the bench for cruelty to convicted felons?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very funny, General,&#x201d; said Hodson. &#x201c;You are correct. Bankruptcies are normally handled by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court&#x2014;right here in this same building. But there have been so many of them the last few years that all the judges in this circuit are taking them now. And besides, these three are special cases and I need to appoint someone as U.S. trustee who knows what he or she is doing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you want me to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hodson finished the sentence: &#x201c;Get off your big general&#x2019;s butt, come down to Richmond, and get sworn in as the U.S. trustee for three of the biggest private armies on the planet. And do it before their heavily armed employees march on Washington.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; replied Newman. &#x201c;How long do I have to think about this?&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly completely serious, Hodson answered, &#x201c;Peter, I&#x2019;m imposing on our friendship&#x2014;but I need your help with this one. Can you come to Richmond this afternoon?&#x201d;<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Three hours after hanging up the phone, Major General Peter Newman, USMC (Ret.), was in the chambers of Senior Judge Henry Hodson on East Main Street in Richmond, Virginia. Two days later, the retired Marine was appointed as U.S. trustee for the three security companies.<br> <br>On Wednesday, 1 May, after twenty-seven days and nights of furious work, and countless meetings with the security companies&#x2019; owners, creditors, clients, lawyers, employees, and accountants, Newman filed a consolidated disclosure of assets and liabilities and presented his reorganization plan. It called for merging the three companies into a single entity, incorporated as Centurion Solutions Group.<br> <br>Judge Hodson approved the plan with one caveat: the owners, clients, and creditors had to agree to have the retired Marine oversee compliance with the reorganization for the next twelve months. Newman and the other parties all agreed, but the arrangement didn&#x2019;t last that long.<br> <br>At a regularly scheduled meeting of the court-appointed Creditors&#x2019; Committee on Monday, 2 December 2013, the owners and creditors of the former companies unanimously nominated Newman to take over full-time management of the new, consolidated corporation. He talked it over, first with Rachel and then with Judge Hodson. Both urged Peter to take the job. Two weeks later Peter Newman became the chairman and chief executive officer of Centurion Solutions Group, Inc.<br> <br>By 2018, the year James Newman graduated from the Naval Academy, CSG had contracts to provide a menu of telecommunications, logistics, security, intelligence, and &#x201c;quick response&#x201d; support for seven U.S. government departments and agencies and fifteen American corporations operating in the United States and overseas. The company also operated Centurion Aviation, a highly profitable, worldwide &#x201c;air taxi&#x201d; service that quietly advertised &#x201c;terror-free flights to where you want to go.&#x201d; CSG even had its own medical staff, disaster relief operations, and a &#x201c;counterpiracy service&#x201d; for international shipping.<br> <br>Though the global economy was still sputtering in the midst of the Great Recession, CSG was quietly flourishing. Despite new laws forbidding American citizens or the foreign employees/contractors of U.S.-owned companies from carrying or using firearms overseas, CSG&#x2019;s &#x201c;security and protective services&#x201d; continued to grow and prosper.<br> <br>How Peter Newman managed to pull this off was a constant source of frustration to the media. Press reports and left-leaning MESH bloggers repeatedly referred to him as a &#x201c;mercenary&#x201d; and called CSG employees and contractors &#x201c;hired guns.&#x201d; Centurion Aviation was routinely castigated for &#x201c;profiling&#x201d; their passengers instead of subjecting them to U.S.-government-approved, FAA-certified &#x201c;biometric validation,&#x201d; full-body scans, and pat-down searches.<br> <br>During a rare interview in 2022, the general was asked, &#x201c;How can your CSG company manage to defy the laws of economic gravity without breaking other laws?&#x201d;<br> <br>Newman attributed the company&#x2019;s success to &#x201c;being blessed with the ability to discern what needs to be done, then finding the right people to do it faster, better, and at lower cost than anyone else.&#x201d;<br> <br>What Newman didn&#x2019;t say was that he personally ensured that all CSG employees&#x2014;including those running Centurion Aviation&#x2014;were former military, CIA, FBI, Secret Service, or DEA personnel with top secret clearances. By the time James left the Marines in 2026 and joined CSG as chief operations officer, the company had grown to nearly 2,500 full-time employees, along with nearly 6,000 contract personnel, and was billing more than $2.9 billion a year.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>James and two of his four boys arrived for breakfast at the stroke of seven fifteen. They raced down the hill from their house on mountain bikes and came charging up the back porch, past the two bewildered Dobermans.<br> <br>&#x201c;Halt! Who goes there?&#x201d; shouted Peter Newman as they burst into the kitchen, out of breath.<br> <br>The twelve-year-old replied first: &#x201c;Lance Corporal Seth Newman, reporting as ordered, sir!&#x201d;<br> <br>Then, from the boy two and a half years younger and a foot shorter, &#x201c;Private First Class Joshua Newman, reporting as ordered, sir!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very well. Advance and be recognized,&#x201d; replied the old general with a smile and a wink at James, standing behind them at the doorway. Then, after hugging them all, he said, &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s ready for chow?&#x201d;<br> <br>As they scrambled for their seats, Rachel came down the stairs and said, &#x201c;Not so fast!

The knitting instructions are rather spare, but the basic sock shape is quite simple, making this a perfect book for intermediate and more advanced knitters who enjoy somewhat unusual projects.</p><h2>Renoir&#39;s Dancer: The Secret Life of Suzanne Valadon</h2><p>In the 1880s, Suzanne Valadon was considered the Impressionists&#x2019; most beautiful model. But behind her captivating fa�ade lay a closely-guarded secret. &nbsp;<br> Born in poverty in rural France, as a teenager in Montmartre, Suzanne began posing for &#x2013; and having affairs with &#x2013; some of the age&#x2019;s most renowned painters. Then Renoir caught her indulging in a passion she had been trying to conceal: the model was herself a talented artist. &nbsp; <br> Some found her vibrant still lifes and frank portraits as shocking as her bohemian lifestyle. At eighteen, she gave birth to an illegitimate child, future painter Maurice Utrillo. But her friends Toulouse-Lautrec and Degas could see her skill. Rebellious and opinionated, she refused to be confined by tradition or gender, and in 1894, her work was accepted to the Salon de la Soci�t� Nationale des Beaux-Arts, an extraordinary achievement for a working-class woman with no formal art training. &nbsp; <br> <i>Renoir&#x2019;s Dancer</i> tells the remarkable tale of an ambitious, headstrong woman fighting to find a professional voice in a male-dominated world.</p><p>CATHERINE HEWITT studied French Literature and Art History at Royal Holloway, University of London and the Courtauld Institute of Art. Her proposal for her first book, <i>The Mistress of Paris</i>, was awarded the runner-up&#x2019;s prize in the 2012 Biographers&#x2019; Club Tony Lothian Competition for the best proposal by an uncommissioned, first-time biographer. She lives in a village in Surrey.&#x201c;Suzanne Valadon may not be a name most people mention when they discuss great artists. This biography should change that. . . . A self-taught artist, she started as a nude model. But when Edgar Degas saw her secret drawings, he said, &#x2018;you are one of us,&#x2019; and helped her become the first woman painter to have works accepted into the Salon de la Soci�t� Nationale desBeaux-Arts. . . . A well-researched tribute to and resurrection of a master of fin de si�cle art.&#x201d;<b> &#x2015;</b><i><b>Kirkus </b></i><b>(starred review)</b></p><h2>Mexico from the Inside Out</h2><p><strong>The debut book from Mexico's best chef, Enrique Olvera of Pujol, pioneer of contemporary, authentic Mexican food and global gourmet influencer.</strong><p></p><p><strong>As featured on Good Morning America.</strong></p><p>Enrique Olvera is the most famous and celebrated Mexican chef working today.

The service was as crisp as the April weather, which, after a long damp winter, was energizing. The elections were over, a new president sat in the White House, and an optimistic mood had begun to replace the pessimism since 9/11.<br>Seated at an upper-level table that looked down on the first floor and entryway, Todd Van Buren sat nursing a Michelob Ultra, waiting for Joshua Givens, a buddy from the University of Mary land, where they&#x2019;d both majored in political science. Todd had minored in international law and languages&#x2014;French, Chinese, and Russian&#x2014;and had been immediately hired by the CIA, while Givens, who&#x2019;d minored in journalism, had started work for the Minneapolis Star, and over the past six years had worked his way up to a well-respected, if junior, investigative journalist with the Washington Post.<br>When he had called this morning and left a message on Todd&#x2019;s voice mail, he sounded frantic, almost frightened.<br>At twenty-nine, Todd was the youngest person ever to run the CIA&#x2019;s training facility, known unofficially as the Farm, with his wife, Elizabeth, at Camp Peary near Williamsburg, 140 miles south of Washington on the York River. His father-in-law was Kirk McGarvey, former director of the agency. He and Liz both had a fair amount of field experience, much of it alongside Liz&#x2019;s father, who&#x2019;d arguably been the Company&#x2019;s finest field agent, bar none. They&#x2019;d practically gone to school on his tradecraft, and once their covers had been blown they&#x2019;d been recruited to run the training facility. Something they&#x2019;d been doing with a great deal of success for the past three years. And after the first three months no one ever questioned their ages.<br>Givens knew that Todd worked for the CIA, just as he knew who Todd&#x2019;s father-in-law was, which made his message this morning all the more cryptic.<br>&#x201c;Trust me on this one, Todd,&#x201d; Givens had said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell anyone we&#x2019;re meeting. No one. Not your wife, and especially not her father.&#x201d;<br>Noon at the George, it was ten after that now, and Todd was beginning to regret driving all the way up from the Farm, and lying to his wife in the bargain, though that had been easy because she was spending the day on an exfiltration exercise with the new class. Tomorrow would be his turn, pushing the twelve field officer trainees as close to the breaking point as he could. He and Liz were hands-on administrators.<br>He would explain to her where he&#x2019;d been when he got back. They&#x2019;d been spies, but they had never lied to each other. She&#x2019;d made him promise before they got married. She loved her father, but he&#x2019;d been gone for almost all of her childhood because he had not been able to tell the truth to his wife, and she&#x2019;d kicked him out of the house. Todd&#x2019;s relationship with Liz was the most important thing in his life, not just because he loved her but because of their two-year-old daughter, Audrey. He owed both of them at least that much.<br>Givens appeared in the doorway from the hotel&#x2019;s lobby, spotted Todd sitting upstairs, and came up. He looked out of breath and flushed, as if he had run all the way in from the Post. Unlike Todd, who was tall, solidly built with a broad, pleasant face, Givens was short and whip thin, his movements quick, almost birdlike. In college Todd had lettered two years as a running back on the football team, while Givens had lettered all four years in cross-country. He&#x2019;d been incredibly fast with the endurance of an iron man, and it didn&#x2019;t look as if he&#x2019;d changed much.<br>&#x201c;Thanks for coming,&#x201d; Givens said, sitting down across from Todd. He laid a computer disk in a jewel case on the table and slid it across. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hold it up, don&#x2019;t look at it, just put it in your pocket.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Todd said. He slipped it into his jacket pocket as their waitress came over.<br>&#x201c;Iced tea, with lemon,&#x201d; Givens said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not staying for lunch.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So, here I am,&#x201d; Todd said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m curious as hell.&#x201d;<br>Givens glanced down at the entryway, and then at the other diners on the lower level, before he turned back. &#x201c;Listen, for the past five months I&#x2019;ve been investigating a power broker group called the Friday Club. And what I&#x2019;m finding out is scaring the crap out of me. Everything I&#x2019;ve come up with so far is on the disk.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Robert Foster,&#x201d; Todd replied. Everyone in Washington knew of the so-called club whose ultra-conservative members called themselves American Firsters. Lobbyists, a number of high-ranking aides and advisers to some key senators and congressmen as well as at least one White House insider, and others. All men, all of them with power.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the top dog,&#x201d; Givens said. &#x201c;And when I started looking it didn&#x2019;t take me long to find out that some of his lobbyist pals represented people like the Saudi royal family, the Venezuelan oil minister, the deputy director of Mexico&#x2019;s intelligence service.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What were you looking for?&#x201d;<br>Givens hesitated. &#x201c;This is going to sound far-fetched. But one of the guys on the list was your deputy director of operations, Howard McCann, who got my attention when he turned up dead in the line of duty.&#x201d;<br>Todd kept any hint of emotion from his face, but alarm bells were jangling all over the place. McCann had been a traitor who&#x2019;d financed the hit on a Chinese general in Pyongyang, and before that was the money-man behind a scheme to smuggle forty kilos of polonium-210 across the border with Mexico. When Todd&#x2019;s father-in-law confronted the man in a safe house just outside Washington, the DDO had pulled out a pistol and it had been Todd who&#x2019;d opened fire, killing him. There&#x2019;d been a lot more to it than that, of course, but to this point they&#x2019;d not been able to figure out where McCann had gotten the money. It was a puzzle.<br>&#x201c;You have my attention, Josh,&#x201d; he said carefully.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the middle of something really big. Maybe even a shadow government. These guys have influenced elections, got federal judges removed from the bench, made sure some top banks and big financial companies got federal backing&#x2014;bailouts just like what happened to Chrysler and just about everyone else a couple of years ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Planning a coup?&#x201d;<br>Givens shook his head. &#x201c;Nothing so messy or dramatic as that. I think they&#x2019;ve already accomplished what they set out to do. They&#x2019;re running things right now. Or at least the important stuff. Guys from the Federal Reserve are in the club, along with a couple of four stars from the Pentagon. This cuts right across the board.&#x201d;<br>Givens looked away for a moment, apparently overwhelmed by what he was saying. When he turned back he&#x2019;d come to some decision.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Todd prompted.<br>&#x201c;Could be the bastards engineered nine/eleven.&#x201d;<br>This was getting over the top for Todd. &#x201c;Do you know how crazy that sounds? Just another conspiracy theory. Our guys deal with that kind of shit twenty-four/seven. Doesn&#x2019;t get us anywhere.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Look what they&#x2019;ve accomplished,&#x201d; Givens said.<br>&#x201c;Tell me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A direct reduction of our civil liberties, for one. For Christ&#x2019;s sake, libraries and bookstores are supposed to inform the FBI what fucking books we&#x2019;re reading. Now you tell me who&#x2019;s crazy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What do your editors over at the Post have to say about it?&#x201d;<br>Givens dismissed the question with a gesture. &#x201c;These aren&#x2019;t the Woodward and Bernstein days. We don&#x2019;t run partial stories hoping the exposure will make other people come forward. Everyone&#x2019;s gotten too smart.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who have you shared this with?&#x201d; Todd was having a lot of doubts. He and Givens hadn&#x2019;t been close, but the guy had never seemed nutsy. And his investigative pieces in the Post had seemed first rate. But this now made no sense.<br>&#x201c;No one. Not even my wife, Karson. Not until I have everything nailed down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll look at your disk,&#x201d; Todd said. &#x201c;Then what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How did McCann die? What was he working on?&#x201d;<br>Todd spread his hands. &#x201c;Even if I knew something like that, which I don&#x2019;t, I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to talk about it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Especially not with a reporter.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Something like that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Give it to your father-in-law then. From what I hear he still carries some weight.&#x201d; Givens looked down at the entryway again, as if he was expecting someone. &#x201c;Hell, I don&#x2019;t have anything solid yet. All I have are a lot of disconnected facts. Sudden changes in government policies, resignations of some key people here and there, upset elections in two dozen key states over the past couple of years. It&#x2019;s all on the disk.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do,&#x201d; Todd said. &#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t promise anything. You&#x2019;ve gotta understand that, Josh.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do what you can,&#x201d; Givens said. &#x201c;What you think is right.&#x201d;<br>His iced tea came, and he drank some of it then got up. &#x201c;I trust you, man. I think you&#x2019;re the only person in the world I can trust.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you if I come up with something,&#x201d; Todd said.<br>&#x201c;Not at the paper,&#x201d; Givens said. He handed Todd a business card. &#x201c;Call me at home.&#x201d; He gave Todd a long, hard look then turned, went downstairs, and left the restaurant.<br>Excerpted from The Cabal by David Hagberg.<br>Copyright � 2010 by David Hagberg.<br>Published in 2010 by A Tom Doherty Associates Book.<br>All rights reserved.

It&#x2019;s a journey where the brothers learned how they must die to their dreams not just once, but twice as they walked away from baseball before being called up to the Big Show and later as their TV series was stripped away from them just before airing when the network succumbed to media pressures surrounding their faith. These experiences only helped them realize that the key to powerful living is found when you die to your dreams and face your fears, and choose to live powerfully through it all. The biblical principles they implemented to guide their work and families are revealed in practical terms to apply to our daily lives and give us courage to stand for what is right. The book will expand on principles such as:<br> </p> <ul> <li>Show that You are Faithful in Little</li> <li>Be a Fountain to Others and not a Drain</li> <li>Produce More in Value than You Receive</li> <li>Work to Your Ability and not Your Pay</li> <li>Breathe Life into All Situations</li> <li>Remember that You are Human Beings, not Human Doings</li> <li>Hold to a Standard of Disciplined Living</li> <li>Don&#x2019;t Swing at Every Pitch</li> <li>Find Your Greatest Blessings on the Other Side of Your Greatest Fears</li> </ul></p><p>DAVID AND JASON BENHAM, former professional baseball players, are also nationally acclaimed entrepreneurs. The twin broth-ers' business success earned them a reality show with HGTV, set to air during the 2014 fall season. Due to their commitment to traditional and biblical values, however, the show was abruptly canceled. The Benhams immediately found themselves in the midst of a cultural fire-storm, but they refused to back down and decided to stand and fight for what they believe.<br> <br>The brothers' first company was recognized as one of Inc. magazine's Fastest Growing Private Companies, and they've been awarded Ernst &amp; Young's Entrepreneur of the Year Finalists, Wall Street Journal's Top Real Estate Professionals, and Business Leader Media's Top 50 Entrepreneurs. They were also named Franchise 500's Top New Franchise.<br> <br>Appearing on CNN, Fox News, TheBlaze, ABC's Nightline, Good Morning America, and others, the Benhams continue to stand up for what they believe. After their show was canceled the Benhams trended nation-ally on social media, and more than 51 million tweets about the Benham brands have been delivered to Twitter streams.<br> <br>David and Jason are happily married, and their families live on the same street in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Italian Food was an inspiration to British cooks when it was first published in 1954 - and it remains so to this day. Embracing the variety, richness and vibrancy of Italian cooking, with particularly reference to regional variation, Elizabeth David provides a magnificent and inspiring collection of favourite dishes as well as those more rarely encountered. With straightforward recipes for meals such as Piedmontese cheese fondue, fettuccine with fresh tomato sauce and chicken breasts with ham and cheese, Elizabeth David brings us the authentic taste of Italian food. &#39;Elizabeth David&#39;s clear and unpretentious directions for the enjoyment of good food have never been surpassed&#39; Daily Mail &#39;Not only did she transform the way we cooked but she is a delight to read&#39; Express on Sunday &#39;Britain&#39;s most inspirational food writer&#39; Independent &#39;When you read Elizabeth David, you get perfect pitch.

Having travelled widely during the Second World War, she introduced post-war Britain to the sun-drenched delights of the Mediterranean and her recipes brought new flavours and aromas into kitchens across Britain. After her classic first book Mediterranean Food followed more bestsellers, including French Country Cooking, Summer Cooking, French Provincial Cooking, Italian Food, Elizabeth David&#39;s Christmas and At Elizabeth David&#39;s Table.</p><p>Elizabeth David (1913-1992) travelled widely during the Second World War, throughout Europe, the Middle East and India.

He was active in all its sectors - shipping, commerce, finance, banking, investment, migration.<br>Brooks was the influential and longest-serving founding director of the Union Bank of Australia and one of the largest importers of wool in London. He managed his manifold business interests from a City counting-house with a handful of clerks, having only once ventured to Australia.<br>This dynamic and innovative business biography looks afresh at the economic relationship between Britain and Australia. It breaks new ground in systematically studying the wool trade, the sailing-ship industry, Australia's import trade, the rise of the City of London and the financial services sector of the British economy, the relationship between business and government, private merchant financing and the connection between corporate and private finance.<br>Parallels between Brooks' career and fluctuations of the Australian trade and economy are striking. And we are reminded that business history must take account of the interests and personality of its leaders. The success of this boy from a Lincolnshire village rested on hard work, caution, flexibility, good personal relations, uncompromising standards, attention to detail and intensive communication with agents. There is much to learn from Frank Broeze's major contribution to Australian and British economic, financial and maritime history.</p><p>Frank Broeze is Associate Professor of History at the University of Western Australia.</p><h2>Math Connects: Concepts, Skills and Problem Solving Course 2, Oklahoma edition. by McGraw Hill.

It's rare to book a plane ticket to visit the lifeless moonscape of Canada's oil sand strip mines, or to seek out the Chinese city of Linfen, legendary as the most polluted in the world. But in <i>Visit Sunny Chernobyl</i>, Andrew Blackwell embraces a different kind of travel, taking a jaunt through the most gruesomely polluted places on Earth. <br><br>From the hidden bars and convenience stores of a radioactive wilderness to the sacred but reeking waters of India, <i>Visit Sunny Chernobyl </i>fuses immersive first-person reporting with satire and analysis, making the case that it's time to start appreciating our planet as it is&#x2014;not as we wish it would be. Irreverent and reflective, the book is a love letter to our biosphere's most tainted, most degraded ecosystems, and a measured consideration of what they mean for us. <br>Equal parts travelogue, expose, environmental memoir, and faux guidebook, Blackwell careens through a rogue's gallery of environmental disaster areas in search of the worst the world has to offer&#x2014;and approaches a deeper understanding of what's really happening to our planet in the process.</p><p>Andrew Blackwell is a journalist and filmmaker living in New York City. He is a 2011 fellow in nonfiction literature from the New York Foundation for the Arts.ONE<br><br>VISIT SUNNY CHERNOBYL<br><br>It began on a train. Vienna to Kiev, rocking back and forth in a cabin of the Kiev Express. There was a certain Agatha Christie-meets-Leonid Brezhnev charm to it. Long oriental rugs ran the length of its corridors, and the passenger compartments were outfitted with a faux wood-grain veneer and dark red seats that folded up to form bunks.<br><br>It's not actually called the Kiev Express. If it were an express, it wouldn't take thirty-six hours. In fact, train is no way to make this trip. I bought my ticket only because I believed, unaccountably, that Vienna and Kiev were close to each other. They are not.<br><br>I was going to Chernobyl, on vacation.<br><br>Trains are for reading, and I had brought a pair of books: Voices from Chernobyl, a collection of survivor interviews, and Wormwood Forest, an investigation of the accident's effect on the environment. I recommend them both, although when I say that trains are for reading, I don't mean that I was doing all that much. Really I was taking an epic series of naps, sporadically interrupted with books.<br><br>My companion in the passenger compartment was Max, a rotund, smiling man in his early thirties. Max spoke in a high, oddly formal voice and looked like a grown-up Charlie Brown, if Charlie Brown had grown up in the USSR. Originally from Kiev, he now worked in Australia as a computer programmer. He had an endearing way of stating the obvious. I would wake up from a nap, my book sliding onto the floor, and look out the window to see that we had stopped in a station.<br><br>"We have stopped," Max would say.<br><br>We spent the first night crossing the length of Slovakia. A beautiful dusk settled over the cracked smokestacks of deserted factories.<br><br>In the morning, we reached the Ukrainian border and rolled into a cluttered rail yard, coming to rest between a set of oversize jacks, taller than the train car itself. A team of crusty rail workers set themselves wrenching and hammering at the wheels of the train, and soon the jacks were raising the entire car into the air, leaving the wheel trucks beneath us on the rails.<br><br>The train tracks in the former Soviet Union don't match those in Europe, you see. So they were changing the wheels on the train.<br><br>"They are changing the wheels on the train," Max said.<br><br>By afternoon we had entered the flowered alpine landscape of the Carpathian Mountains, and Max had become curious about my plans. I chose not to tell him that I was embarking on an epic, years-long quest to visit the world's most polluted places. I just said I was headed for Chernobyl.<br><br>His face lit up. He had stories to tell. In the spring of 1986, when word of the disaster got out, he was eleven years old, living in Kiev. Soon, people were trying to get their children out of the city. It was nearly impossible to get train tickets, Max said, but somehow his family got him onto a train bound southeast for the Crimea. Even though tickets were so hard to come by, the train was nearly empty, and Max implied that the government had manufactured the ticket shortage to keep people from leaving the city.<br><br>"When we arrived," he said, "the train was surrounded by soldiers. They tested everyone and their things for radiation before allowing them to move on. They were trying to keep people from spreading contamination."<br><br>He stayed away from Kiev that entire summer. From his parents, he heard stories about life in the city during those months. The streets were washed down every day. Bakeries that had once left their wares out in the open on shelves now wrapped them in plastic.<br><br>Max talked about the possibility that cancer rates in the area had increased because of Chernobyl, and he told me that his wife, also from Kiev, had abnormalities in her thyroid, which he attributed to radioactive exposure.<br><br>"It's very lucky Kiev didn't get more radiation, thanks to the winds," he said. Then, in his very polite, clipped voice, he asked, "And what do you think about nuclear energy?"<br><br>That night I lay restless in my bunk and imagined--as only an American can&#x2014;the post-Soviet gloom slipping by outside, felt the train shudder as it pushed through the thick ether left behind by an empire. In the book of Chernobyl survivors' stories, I read an account by a firefighter's widow. They were newly married when her husband responded to the fire at the reactor. One of the first at the scene, he received catastrophic doses of radiation and died after two weeks of gruesome illness.<br><br>Desperately in love, his wife had snuck into the hospital to accompany him in his ordeal, even though his very body was dangerously radioactive.<br><br>"I don't know what I should talk about," she says in her account. "About death or about love? Or are they the same?"<br><br>Kiev is a beautiful city, a true Paris of the East, a charming metropolis whose forests of horse chestnut trees set off its ancient churches and classic apartment buildings like jewels on a bed of crumpled green velvet. The trick is to come in the summertime, when a warm breeze blows across the Dnieper River and the bars and cafes spill out into the gentle evening. You can stroll down the Andriyivskyy Descent, lined with cafes and shops, or explore the mysterious catacombs of the Pechersk Lavra, with its menagerie of dead monks. Or you can dive into the city's pulsing downtown nightlife.<br><br>I went straight for the Chernobyl Museum.<br><br>There's a special blend of horror and civic pride on display at any museum dedicated to a local industrial disaster, and the Chernobyl Museum is surely the best of its kind. The place incorporates history, memorial, commentary, art, religion, and even fashion under a curatorial ethos that is the mutant offspring of several different aesthetics.<br><br>In one of the museum's two main halls, I found a bizarre temple-like space. Soothing Russian choral music emanated from the walls. In the center of the room lay a full-size replica of the top face of the infamous reactor. A dugout canoe was suspended above it, heaped with a bewildering mixture of religious images and children's stuffed toys. I tried to understand the room's message, and could not. Empty contamination suits lingered in the shadows, arranged in postures of bafflement and ennui.<br><br>The second hall housed a definitive collection of Chernobyl memorabilia, as well as a tall aluminum scaffold hung with mannequins wearing nuclear cleanup gear. They seemed to be flying in formation, a squad of unusual superheroes. Their leader, arms upraised, wore a black firefighting suit with large white stripes and a metal backpack connected to a gas mask. Through the bubble of the helmet's face guard, I could just make out the cool, retail gaze of a female head, with full eyelashes and painted plastic lips.<br><br>Underneath, there was a cross-sectioned model of the reactor building in its pre-accident state. As I peered into it to get a view of the reactor's inner workings, two docents lurking by the door noticed my interest. Moving with the curt authority of guards, they rushed forward to turn the model on, groping at a control panel attached to the base. The model reactor glowed warmly, showing the normal circulation of water in the core. But the women were unsatisfied. Fussing in Ukrainian, they began flipping the switch back and forth, wiggling and slapping the little control panel with increasing fervor. Finally, they jiggled the switch just right, and the rest of the reactor's systems&#x2014;water and steam pipes, cooling systems and boilers&#x2014;flickered to life.<br><br>To understand the Chernobyl accident, it helps to know something about how electricity gets generated and, specifically, about nuclear power&#x2014;though not so much that your eyes glaze over.<br><br>In general, power plants generate electricity by spinning turbines. Picture a big hamster wheel and you get the idea. Each turbine is connected to a generator, in which a conductor turns through the field of a strong magnet, thus creating electricity by magic. Men in hard hats then distribute this power to entire continents full of televisions and toaster ovens.<br><br>The ageless question, then, is just how to spin all those damn turbines. You can build a dam to collect huge volumes of water that you can let rush through your turbines. You can build windmills with little generators that get powered by the turning rotors. Or you can boil a lot of water and force the steam into the turbine under high pressure.<br><br>This last one works great, but you need a hell of a lot of heat to make enough steam. Where are you going to get it? Well, you can burn coal, natural gas, or even trash, if you like. That, or you can cook up some nuclear fission.<br><br>Oh, fission. People make it sound so complicated, but any chump can get the basics. It involves&#x2014;to skip most of the physics&#x2014;piling up a giant stack of purified uranium to make your reactor's core. You'll have to mix some graphite in with the uranium, to mellow out the neutrons it's emitting.<br><br>We good? Okay. Once you've got the core together, install some plumbing in it so you can run water through to carry off the heat, and then just stand back and cross your fingers.<br><br>A few of the uranium atoms in your core will spontaneously split&#x2014;they're funny that way&#x2014;and when they do, they'll give off heat and some neutrons. It doesn't matter if you don't know what neutrons are, other than that they're tiny and will shoot off like bullets, colliding with neighboring uranium atoms and causing them to split. This will give off more heat and more neutrons, which will cause still further atoms to split, and so on, and so on, and so on. The immense heat created by this chain reaction will heat the water, which will create the steam, which will spin the turbines at terrifying speed, which will turn the generators, which will create an ungodly amount of electricity, which will be used to keep office buildings uncomfortably cold in the middle of summer.<br><br>So far, so good.<br><br>The problem with this chain reaction is that, by its very nature, it tends to run out of control. So to keep your reactor's apocalyptic side in check, you should slide some rods made of boron or hafnium into the reactor core. (Remember to make room for them while you're stacking the uranium.) These rods&#x2014;let's call them control rods&#x2014;will be like sponges, absorbing all those lively, bullet-like neutrons. With the control rods duly inserted, you'll get...nothing.<br><br>The trick, then, is to find the happy medium, while remaining on the correct side of the line that separates air-conditioning from catastrophe. To do this, you'll need to pull the control rods out of the core far enough to let the chain reaction begin, but not so far that it runs out of control. Then you can heat water and spin turbines and generate electricity to your heart's content.<br><br>But pull the control rods out slowly, okay? And for the love of God, please&#x2014;please&#x2014;put them back when you're done.<br><br>With the Chernobyl Museum taken care of, I had a couple of days to kill in Kiev before my excursion to Chernobyl itself, and I spent them exploring my new neighborhood. I was living in style, sidestepping Kiev's overpriced hotels by renting an inexpensive apartment that was nevertheless nicer than any I had ever lived in back home. The front door of my building opened onto the bustling but cozy street of Zhitomirskaya, and it was an easy walk to Saint Sophia Square. There was also a nice terrace park where the young and hip of Kiev would gather in the late afternoon to throw Frisbees, play bongo drums, and drink beer in the glow of the sunset.<br><br>It all filled me with a churning panic. I just don't like being a clueless foreigner in a strange city where I've got no friends. I was also having trouble finding a portable radiation detector for my trip to the Exclusion Zone around Chernobyl. The detector would come in handy for measuring my radioactive exposure, with great precision, in units I wouldn't understand.<br><br>But Amazon didn't deliver overnight to Kiev, and so I was out of ideas. It was time to be resourceful&#x2014;I had to get someone else to figure it out.<br><br>If journalism can teach us anything, it's that local people are a powerful tool to save us from our own fecklessness and incompetence. We call them fixers. In my case, I hired a capable young journalism school graduate called Olena. Skeptical at first, she soon realized that I was less interested in a simple rehash of the local disaster story than in exploring new touristic horizons, and she warmed to the concept. Olena set to work finding the radiation detector, calling one Chernobyl-related bureaucracy after another. To our surprise, nobody had any ideas. Even the government's Chernobyl ministry, Chernobylinterinform, was clueless. Measuring radiation didn't seem to be much of a priority among the citizens of Kiev. Maybe they just didn't want to think about what lay a short way upriver.<br><br>It's possible there is wisdom in such willful ignorance. The subject of radiation, after all, is so mysterious, and its units and measurement so confusing, that carrying around a little beeping gadget may not, in the end, leave you any better informed about your safety.<br><br>But every visitor to Chernobyl should have a working understanding of radiation and how it's measured. So let's review the basics. You can skip this section if you want, but you'll miss the part where I tell you the one weird old tip for repelling gamma rays.<br><br>Radiation, as far as tourists need be concerned, comes in three flavors: alpha, beta, and gamma. One source of radiation is unstable atoms&#x2014;those same atoms that are so useful in building a nuclear core. In contrast to lighter, trustier elements like iron or helium, uncomfortably obese elements like uranium and plutonium are always looking for excuses to shed bits of themselves. That is to say, they are radioactive. These unstable elements will occasionally fart out things we call alpha or beta particles or gamma rays&#x2014;the latter being the nasty stuff. This process&#x2014;called decay- -leaves the atom a bit smaller and sometimes with a different name, as it is alchemically transformed from one radioactive element into another.<br><br>Once in a while, an atom will suffer a complete breakdown and split in half. That's fission. After the split, particles and gamma rays spew off in all directions, and two atoms of a lighter element are left behind.</p><h2>The Abominables</h2><p>&nbsp; Renowned literary great Eva Ibbotson delivers a final novel in her classic, much-loved style. A previously unpublished work from this favorite author, <i>The Abominables </i>follows a family of yetis who are forced, by tourism, to leave their home in the Himalayas and make their way across Europe to a possible new home. Siblings Con and Ellen shepherd the yetis along their eventful journey, with the help of Perry, a good-natured truck driver. Through a mountain rescue in the Alps and a bullfight in Spain, the yetis at last find their way to an ancestral estate in England&#x2015;only to come upon a club of voracious hunters who have set their sights on the most exotic prey of all: the Abominable Snowmen.<br> Briskly funny and full of incident, <i>The Abominables </i>is vintage Ibbotson. With unforgettable characters and thoughtful messages about the environment and advocacy, it&#x2019;s a generous last gift to her many devoted fans.<br> <br> <b>Praise for <i>The Abominables</i></b><br> <b>STARRED REVIEW</b><b>S</b><br> "A satiric farewell from a favorite author."<br> --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review<br> <br> "A memorable finale to a treasured body of work."<br> --<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review<br> <br> "The novel is full of whimsy, charm, and sly humor.

Her novels include <i>The Secret of Platform 13</i>, <i>Which Witch?</i>, <i>The Great Ghost Rescue</i>, <i>Island of the Aunt</i>, <i>Dial-a-Ghost</i>, and <i>Journey to the River Sea</i>, which won the Smarties Prize. She died in 2010, in her home in Newcastle, England.<b><p></p></b>Gr 4-6-Lady Agatha Farlingham, an aristocratic girl, is kidnapped by a Himalayan yeti and taken to Nanvi Dar. As it turns out, the yeti and his ilk aren't the least bit abominable; they are kind and gentle. Agatha spends a long and happy life in Nanvi Dar, teaching her yetis English, proper manners, and values. When the now-elderly woman decides that her family of yetis must be transported to a safer place to escape tourists and hunters, siblings Con and Ellen, along with Perry the truck driver, aid them in the long journey to Agatha's ancestral Hampshire home. On the trip, the group saves the reputations of hapless St. Bernards, frees an entire zoo from a sultan's tyranny, and stops a Spanish bullfight. Once the yetis arrive at Farley Towers, they find it occupied by the Hunters' Club, who drop the yetis off in the middle of the Antarctic and plan to gun them down for sport. The novel is full of whimsy, charm, and sly humor. The yetis will tug at readers' heartstrings and make them laugh. The writing is lean, witty, and subtle. Ibbotson manages to touch on ethical messages of human rights, advocacy, and environmentalism without being obvious. The many happenings and asides within the narrative do not feel at all episodic but, instead, drive the plot forward in a smooth and logical manner. Struggling readers may have trouble deciphering a few British colloquialisms but will appreciate the quick pace of the prose. Published posthumously, this novel is a true gem among Ibbotson's many fine fantasies.-Elly Schook, Jamieson Elementary School, Chicago&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Few since have taken such literary risks, developed such individual political or spiritual ideas, or spanned such a wide range of media. Burroughs wrote novels, memoirs, technical manuals, and poetry. He painted, made collages, took thousands of photographs, produced hundreds of hours of experimental recordings, acted in movies, and recorded more CDs than most rock bands. Burroughs was the original cult figure of the Beat Movement, and with the publication of his novel <i>Naked Lunch</i>, which was originally banned for obscenity, he became a guru to the 60s youth counterculture. In <b>CALL ME BURROUGHS</b>, biographer and Beat historian Barry Miles presents the first full-length biography of Burroughs to be published in a quarter century-and the first one to chronicle the last decade of Burroughs's life and examine his long-term cultural legacy.<br> Written with the full support of the Burroughs estate and drawing from countless interviews with figures like Allen Ginsberg, Lucien Carr, and Burroughs himself, <b>CALL ME BURROUGHS</b> is a rigorously researched biography that finally gets to the heart of its notoriously mercurial subject.<br></p><p>Barry Miles is the author of many seminal books on popular culture, including the authorized biography of Paul McCartney, <i>Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now</i>; <i>Ginsberg: A Biography</i>; <i>William Burroughs: El Hombre Invisible</i>; <i>Jack Kerouac: King of the Beats</i>; and <i>The Beat Hotel: Ginsberg, Burroughs, and Corso in Paris, 1957-1963</i>. He also co-edited the Revised Text Edition of <i>Naked Lunch. Miles</i> was born in Cirencester, England."The Burroughs of Miles's 600-plus pages is both ghastlier and more impressive than previous models, sliding through the world like a cross between Sam Spade and Flat Stanley."'&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Atlantic</i></i></b><br><br>"CALL ME BURROUGHS is riddled with... weird anecdotes laced with gallows humor, bizarre coincidences and profane punch lines. It's a massive undertaking made complicated by Burroughs' peripatetic lifestyle and rampant drug use. To say he was a difficult man to pin down is understatement, but Miles is up to the task."&#x2015;<b><i><i>LA Times</i></i></b><br><br>"Miles just puts it all on paper with aplomb and deadpan wit, showing how the gross-out surrealism of Burroughs's fiction flowed from the lurid creativity of everyday life."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publisher's Weekly</i> (<b>Starred Review</b>)</i></b><br><br>"One long, strange, profoundly American literary life. Burroughs's work has had a profound if often oblique influence on the writing of his century and this one. I can scarcely imagine what it would be like to read Barry Miles's biography without being thoroughly familiar with the outline of the narrative. Truly, stranger than fiction."&#x2015;<b><i>William Gibson</i></b><br><br>"CALL ME BURROUGHS takes us deeply inside the magical life of the great writer. Miles's decision to tell the epic story through William Burroughs's search for his 'Ugly Spirit' makes for sensational reading. Brilliant, tragic, controversial, and inspiring, CALL ME BURROUGHS is a beautiful work."&#x2015;<b><i>Victor Bockris, author of <i>With William Burroughs: A Report from the Bunker</i>, <i>Conversations with William Burroughs</i> and <i>Andy Warhol, and Burroughs in the Bunker</i></i></b><br><br>"CALL ME BURROUGHS is the most intimate portrait to date of one of the twentieth century's most complicated, troubled, and influential figures. Miles's deep knowledge of the man and the work also provides a cultural history of the scene in Tangiers in the 1950s, the Beat era, and the emerging Punk scene in New York in the 1980s. It is a compelling biography and social history unlike any other."&#x2015;<b><i>Ira Silverberg, co-editor of <i>Word Virus: The William S. Burroughs Reader</i></i></b><br><br>"CALL ME BURROUGHS is full of energy and surprise and is a delight to read. Barry Miles combines his intimate knowledge of Burroughs with the meticulous research of Burroughs's companion James Grauerholz, to produce an extremely accurate, readable, and entertaining biography of one of the most inventive writers of the twentieth century. Reading this extraordinary book is like hanging around with Burroughs himself and is impossible to forget."&#x2015;<b><i>Bill Morgan, author of I <i>Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg and The Typewriter Is Holy</i></i></b><br><br>"By any standard Burroughs's was an unusual life, full of scandal, subversion, and sensitivity hidden behind a cold blue gaze. Miles enriches this 'life of an artist' with decades of dedicated immersion in the work both published and unpublished, digging deep into archival material and manuscripts, incorporating journals of friends and acquaintances. With great authority and verve, he brings up to date the legacy of a true American original who grows, even years after his death, in fascination."&#x2015;<b><i>Regina Weinreich, author of <i>Kerouac's Spontaneous Poetics </i>and editor of <i>Kerouac's Book of Haikus</i></i></b></p><h2>The Ghosts of Belfast (The Belfast Novels)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;The best first novel I&#x2019;ve read in years...It&#x2019;s a flat-out terror trip.&#x201d;&#x2014;James Ellroy</b> <br><br>&#x201c;Not only one of the finest thriller debuts of the last ten years, but also <b>one of the best Irish novels, in any genre</b>, of recent times.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>John Connolly</b> <br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Ghosts of Belfast </i>is the book when the world finally sits up and goes WOW, the <b>Irish really have taken over the world of crime writing</b>.

Gerry Fegan<br>told himself that lie before every swallow. He chased the whiskey&#x2019;s<br>burn with a cool black mouthful of Guinness and placed the glass back<br>on the table.&nbsp;<i>Look up and they&#x2019;ll be gone</i>, he thought.<br>No. They were still there, still staring. Twelve of them if he counted<br>the baby in its mother&#x2019;s arms.<br>He was good and drunk now. When his stomach couldn&#x2019;t hold<br>any more he would let Tom the barman show him to the door, and<br>the twelve would follow Fegan through the streets of Belfast, into his<br>house, up his stairs, and into his bedroom. If he was lucky, and drunk<br>enough, he might pass out before their screaming got too loud to<br>bear. That was the only time they made a sound, when he was alone<br>and on the edge of sleep. When the baby started crying, that was the<br>worst of it.<br>Fegan raised the empty glass to get Tom&#x2019;s attention.<br>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you had enough, Gerry?&#x201d; Tom asked. &#x201c;Is it not home<br>time yet? Everyone&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;One more,&#x201d; Fegan said, trying not to slur. He knew Tom would<br>not refuse. Fegan was still a respected man in West Belfast, despite the<br>drink.<br>Sure enough, Tom sighed and raised a glass to the optic. He<br>brought the whiskey over and counted change from the stained table -<br>top. The gummy film of old beer and grime sucked at his shoes as he<br>walked away.<br>Fegan held the glass up and made a toast to his twelve companions.<br>One of the five soldiers among them smiled and nodded in return.<br>The rest just stared.<br>&#x201c;Fuck you,&#x201d; Fegan said. &#x201c;Fuck the lot of you.&#x201d;<br>None of the twelve reacted, but Tom looked back over his<br>shoulder. He shook his head and continued walking to the bar.<br>Fegan looked at each of his companions in turn. Of the five<br>soldiers three were Brits and two were Ulster Defence Regiment.<br>Another of the followers was a cop, his Royal Ulster Constabulary<br>uniform neat and stiff, and two more were Loyalists, both Ulster<br>Freedom Fighters. The remaining four were civilians who had<br>been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He remembered doing<br>all of them, but it was the civilians whose memories screamed the<br>loudest.<br>There was the butcher with his round face and bloody apron. Fegan<br>had dropped the package in his shop and held the door for the woman<br>and her baby as she wheeled the pram in. They&#x2019;d smiled at each other.<br>He&#x2019;d felt the heat of the blast as he jumped into the already moving<br>car, the blast that should have come five minutes after they&#x2019;d cleared<br>the place.<br>The other was the boy. Fegan still remembered the look in his eyes<br>when he saw the pistol. Now the boy sat across the table, those same<br>eyes boring into him.<br>Fegan couldn&#x2019;t hold his gaze, so he turned his eyes downward.<br>Tears pooled on the tabletop. He brought his fingers to the hollows of<br>his face and realised he&#x2019;d been weeping.<br>&#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; he said.<br>He wiped the table with his sleeve and sniffed back the tears. The<br>pub&#x2019;s stale air clung to the back of his throat, as thick as the duncolored<br>paint on the walls. He scolded himself. He neither needed nor<br>deserved pity, least of all his own. Weaker men than him could live<br>with what they&#x2019;d done. He could do the same.<br>A hand on his shoulder startled him.<br>&#x201c;Time you were going, Gerry,&#x201d; Michael McKenna said.<br>Tom slipped into the storeroom behind the bar. McKenna paid<br>him to be discreet, to see and hear nothing.<br>Fegan knew the politician would come looking for him. He was<br>smartly dressed in a jacket and trousers, and his fine-framed designer<br>glasses gave him the appearance of an educated man. A far cry from<br>the teenager Fegan had run the streets with thirty years ago. Wealth<br>looked good on him.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just finishing,&#x201d; Fegan said.<br>&#x201c;Well, drink up and I&#x2019;ll run you home.&#x201d; McKenna smiled down at<br>him, his teeth white and even. He&#x2019;d had them fixed so he could look<br>presentable for the cameras. The party leadership had insisted on it<br>before they gave him the nomination for his seat in the Assembly. At<br>one time, not so long past, it had been against party policy to take a<br>seat at Stormont. But times change, even if people don&#x2019;t.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll walk,&#x201d; Fegan said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a couple of minutes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no trouble,&#x201d; McKenna said. &#x201c;Besides, I wanted a word.&#x201d;<br>Fegan nodded and took another mouthful of stout. He held it on<br>his tongue when he noticed the boy had risen from his place on the<br>other side of the table. It took a moment to find him, shirtless and<br>skinny as the day he died, creeping up behind McKenna.<br>The boy pointed at the politician&#x2019;s head. He mimed firing, his<br>hand thrown upwards by the recoil. His mouth made a plosive<br>movement, but no sound came.<br>Fegan swallowed the Guinness and stared at the boy. Something<br>stirred in his mind, one memory trying to find another. The chill at<br>his center pulsed with his heartbeat.<br>&#x201c;Do you remember that kid?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t, Gerry.&#x201d; McKenna&#x2019;s voice carried a warning.<br>&#x201c;I met his mother today. I was in the graveyard and she came up to<br>me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know you did,&#x201d; McKenna said, taking the glass from Fegan&#x2019;s<br>fingers.<br>&#x201c;She said she knew who I was. What I&#x2019;d done. She said&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Gerry, I don&#x2019;t want to know what she said. I&#x2019;m more curious<br>about what you said to her. That&#x2019;s what we need to talk about. But<br>not here.&#x201d; McKenna squeezed Fegan&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Come on, now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He hadn&#x2019;t done anything. Not really. He didn&#x2019;t tell the cops<br>anything they didn&#x2019;t know already. He didn&#x2019;t deserve that. Jesus, he<br>was seventeen. We didn&#x2019;t have to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>One hard hand gripped Fegan&#x2019;s face, the other his thinning hair,<br>and the animal inside McKenna showed itself. &#x201c;Shut your fucking<br>mouth,&#x201d; he hissed. &#x201c;Remember who you&#x2019;re talking to.&#x201d;<br>Fegan remembered only too well. As he looked into those fierce<br>blue eyes he remembered every detail. This was the face he knew, not<br>the one on television, but the face that burned with white-hot pleasure<br>as McKenna set about the boy with a claw hammer, the face that was<br>dotted with red when he handed Fegan the .22 pistol to finish it.<br>Fegan gripped McKenna&#x2019;s wrists and prised his hands away. He<br>stamped on his own anger, quashed it.<br>The smile returned to McKenna&#x2019;s lips as he pulled his hands away<br>from Fegan&#x2019;s, but went no further. &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;My car&#x2019;s<br>outside. I&#x2019;ll run you home.&#x201d;<br>The twelve followed them out to the street, the boy sticking close<br>to McKenna. McKenna had climbed high in the party hierarchy, but<br>not so high he needed an escort to guard him. Even so, Fegan knew<br>the Mercedes gleaming in the orange street lights was armored, both<br>bullet- and bomb-proof. McKenna probably felt safe as he lowered<br>himself into the driver&#x2019;s seat.<br>&#x201c;Big day today,&#x201d; McKenna said as he pulled the car away from the<br>curb, leaving the followers staring after them. &#x201c;Sorting the offices up<br>at Stormont, my own desk and everything. Who&#x2019;d have thought it,<br>eh? The likes of us up on the hill. I wangled a secretary&#x2019;s job for the<br>wife. The Brits are throwing so much money at this I almost feel bad<br>taking it off them. Almost.&#x201d;<br>McKenna flashed Fegan a smile. He didn&#x2019;t return it.<br>Fegan tried to avoid seeing or reading the news as much as he could,<br>but the last two months had been a hurricane of change. Just five<br>months ago, as one year turned to the next, they&#x2019;d said it was hopeless;<br>the political process was beyond repair. Then mountains moved, deals<br>were struck, another election came and went, while the shadows<br>gathered closer to Fegan. And more often than before, those shadows<br>turned to faces and bodies and arms and legs. Now they were a<br>constant, and he couldn&#x2019;t remember when he last slept without first<br>drowning them in whiskey.<br>They&#x2019;d been with him since his last weeks in the Maze prison, a<br>little over seven years ago. He&#x2019;d just been given his release date,<br>printed on a sheet of paper in a sealed envelope, and his mouth was<br>dry when he opened it. The politicians on the outside had bartered for<br>his freedom, along with hundreds more men and women. They called<br>people like him political prisoners. Not murderers or thieves, not<br>extortionists or blackmailers. Not criminals of any kind, just victims<br>of circumstance. The followers were there when Fegan looked up<br>from the letter, watching.<br>He told one of the prison psychologists about it. Dr. Brady said it<br>was guilt. A manifestation, he called it. Fegan wondered why people<br>seldom called things by their real names.<br>McKenna pulled the Mercedes into the curb outside Fegan&#x2019;s small<br>terraced house on Calcutta Street. It stood shoulder to shoulder with<br>two dozen identical red-brick boxes, drab and neat. The followers<br>waited on the pavement.<br>&#x201c;Can I come in for a second?&#x201d; McKenna&#x2019;s smile sparkled in the<br>car&#x2019;s interior lighting, and kind lines arced out from around his eyes.<br>&#x201c;Better to talk inside, eh?&#x201d;<br>Fegan shrugged and climbed out.<br>The twelve parted to let him approach his door. He unlocked it and<br>went inside, McKenna following, the twelve slipping in between.<br>Fegan headed straight for the sideboard where a bottle of Jameson&#x2019;s<br>and a jug of water awaited him. He showed McKenna the bottle.<br>&#x201c;No, thanks,&#x201d; McKenna said. &#x201c;Maybe you shouldn&#x2019;t, either.&#x201d;<br>Fegan ignored him, pouring two fingers of whiskey into a glass and<br>the same of water. He took a deep swallow and extended his hand<br>towards a chair.<br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m all right,&#x201d; McKenna said. His hair was well barbered, his<br>skin tanned and smooth, a scar beneath his left eye the only remainder<br>of his old self.<br>The twelve milled around the sparsely furnished room, merging<br>with and diverging from the shadows, studying each man intently.<br>The boy lingered by McKenna&#x2019;s side as the politician went to the<br>unstrung guitar propped in the corner. He picked it up and turned it<br>in the light.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Since when did you play guitar?&#x201d; McKenna asked.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Fegan said. &#x201c;Put it down.&#x201d;<br>McKenna read the label inside the sound hole. &#x201c;Martin. Looks old.<br>What&#x2019;s it doing here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It belonged to a friend of mine. I&#x2019;m restoring it,&#x201d; Fegan said. &#x201c;Put<br>it down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What friend?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just someone I knew inside. Please. Put it down.&#x201d;<br>McKenna set it back in the corner. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to have friends,<br>Gerry. You should value them. Listen to them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d you want to talk about?&#x201d; Fegan lowered himself into a chair.<br>McKenna nodded at the drink in Fegan&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;About that, for<br>one thing. It&#x2019;s got to stop, Gerry.&#x201d;<br>Fegan held the politician&#x2019;s eyes as he drained the glass.<br>&#x201c;People round here look up to you. You&#x2019;re a Republican hero. The<br>young fellas need a role model, someone they can respect.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Respect? What are you talking about?&#x201d; Fegan put the glass on the<br>coffee table. The chill of condensation clung to his palm and he let his<br>hands slide together, working the moisture over his knuckles and<br>between his fingers. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no respecting what I&#x2019;ve done.&#x201d;<br>McKenna&#x2019;s face flushed with anger. &#x201c;You did your time. You were<br>a political prisoner for twelve years. A dozen years of your life given up<br>for the cause. Any Republican should respect that.&#x201d; His expression<br>softened. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re pissing it away, Gerry. People are starting to<br>notice. Every night you&#x2019;re at the bar, drunk off your face, talking to<br>yourself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not talking to myself.&#x201d; Fegan went to point at the followers,<br>but thought better of it.<br>&#x201c;Then who&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>you talking to?&#x201d; McKenna&#x2019;s voice wavered with an<br>exasperated laugh.<br>&#x201c;The people I killed. The people&nbsp;<i>we&nbsp;</i>killed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Watch your mouth, Gerry. I never killed anybody.&#x201d;<br>Fegan met McKenna&#x2019;s blue eyes. &#x201c;No, the likes of you and<br>McGinty were always too smart to do it yourselves. You used mugs<br>like me instead.&#x201d;<br>McKenna folded his arms across his barrel chest. &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s hands<br>are clean.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What else?&#x201d; Fegan asked. &#x201c;You said &#x2018;for one thing&#x2019;. What else do<br>you want?&#x201d;<br>McKenna circled the room, the boy following, and Fegan had to<br>twist in his chair to keep him in sight. &#x201c;I need to know what you told<br>that woman,&#x201d; McKenna said.<br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; Fegan said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not much of a talker. You know that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re not. But a reliable source tells me the cops are going to<br>start digging up the bogs near Dungannon in the next few days.<br>Round about where we buried that boy. His mother told them where<br>to look.&#x201d; McKenna moved to the center of the room and loomed over<br>Fegan. &#x201c;Now, how did she know that, Gerry?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Does it matter?&#x201d; Fegan asked. &#x201c;Jesus, there&#x2019;ll be nothing left of<br>him. It&#x2019;s been more than twenty years.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It matters,&#x201d; McKenna said. &#x201c;If you open your mouth, you&#x2019;re a<br>tout. And you know what happens to touts.&#x201d;<br>Fegan tightened his fingers on the chair&#x2019;s armrests.<br>McKenna leaned down, his hands on his thighs. &#x201c;Why, Gerry?<br>Why&#x2019;d you tell her? What good did you think it&#x2019;d do?&#x201d;<br>Fegan searched for a lie, anything, but found nothing. &#x201c;I thought<br>maybe he&#x2019;d leave me alone,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; McKenna straightened.<br>&#x201c;I thought he&#x2019;d go,&#x201d; Fegan said. He looked at the boy aiming his<br>fingers at McKenna&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;I thought he&#x2019;d leave me alone. Give me<br>some peace.&#x201d;<br>McKenna took a step back. &#x201c;Who? The boy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But that wasn&#x2019;t what he wanted.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Christ, Gerry.&#x201d; McKenna shook his head. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened to<br>you? Maybe you should see a doctor, you know, get straight. Go away<br>for a while.&#x201d;<br>Fegan looked down at his hands. &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Listen.&#x201d; McKenna put a hand on Fegan&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;My source<br>talks only to me, nobody else. You&#x2019;ve been a good friend to me over<br>the years, and that&#x2019;s the only reason I haven&#x2019;t gone to McGinty with<br>this. If he knew you opened your mouth to that auld doll, it&#x2019;s your<br>body the cops would be looking for.&#x201d;<br>Fegan wanted to jerk his shoulder away from McKenna&#x2019;s hand. He<br>sat still.<br>&#x201c;Of course, I might need you to return the favor. There&#x2019;s work I<br>could put your way. I&#x2019;ve a few deals going on, stuff McGinty isn&#x2019;t in<br>on. If you can stay off the drink, get yourself right, you could be a big<br>help to me. And McGinty doesn&#x2019;t need to know what you said to that<br>boy&#x2019;s mother.&#x201d;<br>Fegan watched the boy&#x2019;s face contort as the other shadows gathered<br>around him.<br>&#x201c;Do you understand what I&#x2019;m saying to you, Gerry?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Fegan said.<br>&#x201c;Good man.&#x201d; McKenna smiled.<br>Fegan stood. &#x201c;I need a piss.&#x201d;<br>McKenna stepped back and said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be long.&#x201d;<br>Fegan made his way up the stairs and into the bathroom. He closed<br>and bolted the door but, as always, the followers found their way in.<br>Except the boy. Fegan paid it little mind, instead concentrating on<br>keeping upright while he emptied his bladder. He had long since<br>gotten used to the twelve witnessing his most undignified moments.<br>He flushed, rinsed his hands under the tap, and opened the door.<br>The boy was there, on the landing, waiting for him. He stared into the<br>darkness of Fegan&#x2019;s bedroom.<br>Fegan stood for a moment, confused, as his temples buzzed and the<br>chill pulsed at his center.<br>The boy pointed into the room.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Fegan asked.<br>The boy bared his teeth, and his skinny arm jerked towards the<br>door.<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Fegan said. He walked to h...</p><h2>Nausica� of the Valley of the Wind, Vol. 1</h2><p>In the tradition of J.R.R. Tolkien comes an epic environmental cautionary tale created by world-renowned animator Hayao Miyazaki! Humanity in its hubris, has precipitated a devastating ecological disaster. Flourishing industrial civilizations have been swallowed up and Earth is covered with the Sea of Corruption, an enormous forest of fungi that releases a miasma of poisonous spores into the air. Nausicaa, a gentle young princess, has an empathetic bond with the giant mutated insects that evolved in the wake of the destruction of the ecosystem. Traveling by cumbersome flying ship, on the backs of giant flightless birds, and perched atop her beloved glider, Nausicaa and her allies must negotiate peace between kingdoms battling over the last of the world&#39;s precious natural resources.</p><p>Hayao Miyazaki is probably best known in the West for his films; <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i> and <i>Kiki's Delivery Service</i> are celebrated for their lavish animation and sophisticated treatment of their young heroes. But among his many fans in Japan, his epic <i>manga</i> tale, <i>Nausica� of the Valley of Wind</i>, which Miyazaki later made into a animated movie, is often cited as his greatest work. Indeed, the <i>Comics Journal</i> once described the first volume as "the best graphic novel ever." Many critics favorably compare the story to such fantasy classics as C.S. Lewis's <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> or J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. <p> In <i>Nausica�</i>, as in most of his work, Miyazaki centers his narrative on a strong young woman who struggles to create peace in a world torn by war. Readers of Homer's <i>The Odyssey</i> will recall that Nausica� is the name of the Phoenician princess who healed Odysseus when he washed up on her shores. Miyazaki took that character as the inspiration for his Princess Nausica�, but their worlds could not be further apart. Underscoring the book's deep ecological messages, Miyazaki's Nausica� is a passionate defender of the natural world, and her ability to commune with the creatures of the forest appears almost magical. As a princess, she is testing the waters of leadership as her father languishes on his deathbed. As a citizen of the Valley of Wind, she has mastered reading the shifting wind currents and air pockets as she navigates the skies in her glider. </p><p> Readers learn at the beginning of her tale that the Earth has become a hostile place. Environmental crises have made the forest--known as the Sea of Corruption--into a kingdom of spores and giant insects called Ohmu. The remaining humans huddle in the valleys and sheltered cities while holding on to the remnants of technologies long-since rendered mysterious. Now, the Imperial family has begun a massive campaign to extend its hold on the remaining pockets of civilization. However, intrigue between the reigning Princess Kushana and her brothers suddenly place Nausica� and her people at the center of a civil conflict that could extinguish the last people on earth. With the grandeur of Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and the grace of Miyazaki's <i>Totoro</i>, <i>Nausica� of the Valley of Wind</i> is a classic of fantasy literature and one of the finest works ever in the comics medium. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p></p><h2>Josefina&#39;s Surprise: A Christmas Story (American Girl Collection)</h2><p>The second Christmas after their mother has died, Josefina and her three sisters find that participating in the traditions of Las Posadas helps keep memories of Mam�a alive.</p><p></p><h2>Zuckerman Bound</h2><p>Four complete works by Philip Roth in one volume.

But someone is threatening the entire system and the worlds it serves with a military force that could wreak interstellar havoc. Worse yet, a more subtle and sinister threat lurks: the Modhri, whose unique coral is prized throughout the galaxy, but which has properties that may create addiction--or worse. Compton, a sharp investigator, lost his job with Earth's security forces when he exposed a corrupt scheme that had roots in high places. Enlisted by the Spiders to find out who's trying to take over the Quadrail, he's got his hands full, because he's got beings of many races gunning for him to keep him from discovering a far-flung conspiracy that could destroy every civilization in the galaxy.<br><br>The result is one of Zahn's most memorable and compelling novels in years.<br></p><p>Timothy Zahn has written more than twenty SF novels and six <i>Star Wars </i>tie-in novels, including the all-time bestselling <i>Heir to the Empire</i>. His YA novel <i>Dragon and Thief</i> was named an ALA Best Book for Young Adults. Zahn won a Hugo Award for his novella "Cascade Point." He resides in coastal Oregon.<br>Hang on! Hugo-winner Zahn (<i>Cascade Point</i>) takes off on a rip-roaring interstellar train ride with hard-boiled hero Frank Compton, recently fired from Earth's Western Alliance Intelligence for whistle-blowing on the costly Yandro colony boondoggle, a U.N. scheme to make humanity a real interstellar power. From Earth's mean streets, Compton hops the Quadrail, a mysterious galactic system run by the alien Spiders, who give him four months to defuse an interstellar war being engineered by the gestalt entity the Modhri. With Bayta, "The Girl" sent by the Spiders to recruit him, Compton blasts his way through layers of subterfuge and teams of unpronounceable alien baddies. Seeing a new chunk of the truth fall into place about every hundred pages, Compton carries comic-strip action to dizzying extremes in this highballing romp. Situations predictable from tough-guy PI fiction and characters straight out of Dick Tracy (even though some wear chipmunk fur and others inhabit telepathic coral colonies) make this night train a juicily familiar joyride. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This sense of contentment continued right up until the day, a few years ago, when he learned that Thomas Earl Batts had decided to also become Anthony Dwight Stone, and the world got a little too crowded.<br><br>The real Anthony Stone was driving through Nash County, North Carolina, when he was stopped for speeding. When his license was inspected, the police gave him the news that he was wanted for drug possession. Geez, he said, they had to be kidding. They weren&#x2019;t, and he got tossed in jail for the night. Then the police showed him a picture that was supposedly him. It was of a man with his hair coiled in braids and a stomach that ran on forever who easily weighed three hundred pounds; Stone boasted curly hair and weighed 170, tops. He recognized the man right away. That was Thomas Earl Batts, his sister&#x2019;s boyfriend.<br><br>Being his sister&#x2019;s boyfriend had made it pretty easy for Batts to gather the necessary information&#x2014;Social Security number and a few other key facts&#x2014;and slip into Anthony Stone&#x2019;s identity. And it certainly changed Anthony Stone&#x2019;s view of what sisters are for.<br><br>As it turned out, Stone said, Batts had quietly appropriated Stone&#x2019;s identity some ten years earlier and had been living right alongside him, using credit cards in Stone&#x2019;s name to buy various necessary and unnecessary merchandise. He had gone and gotten a loan in Stone&#x2019;s name to purchase a house. And out of force of bad habit, he had built up a tidy little rap sheet.<br><br>None of this was a good thing for Anthony Stone. Batts, for instance, didn&#x2019;t bother to keep current with his credit. But then, what did he care? He wasn&#x2019;t really Anthony Stone. And so the real Anthony Stone found himself branded as a congenital loser. He had an impossible time getting credit&#x2014;any credit. &#x201c;Doors of all kind were shut in my face,&#x201d; he said. He&#x2019;d apply for a job and would be promptly turned down; once he found work and, after a lagging credit check, was whisked right out of a company car.<br><br>When he belatedly got around to applying to college, he got nothing but rejections, since his sketchy credit and criminal misdeeds weren&#x2019;t quite what the admissions people had in mind for their incoming class. It didn&#x2019;t seem to matter that it wasn't his credit record or his criminal record. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d get into my apartment and get a notice six or seven times that I was evicted,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I felt like life had stopped.&#x201d;<br><br>It took years to untangle the mess. And Anthony Stone had to wonder, what if it happened again? Which is why he went to court and changed his name to Stone Tyler, essentially ceding his old identity to the dustbin. At the same time, he applied for a new Social Security number. He was laughed at and told it couldn&#x2019;t be done, but he ultimately did get it done. &#x201c;Basically, you can&#x2019;t get your Social Security number changed unless it&#x2019;s life&#x2013;threatening,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Tyler, who lives in Durham, North Carolina, at last got into college and found a job with Blue Cross Blue Shield. Batts served a brief jail sentence, and that was it. For many people, the metamorphosis that Stone Tyler chose&#x2014;new name, new Social Security number&#x2014;might seem like an extreme response to an admittedly awful situation, and I wouldn&#x2019;t recommend going quite that far. But from where he sat he saw no choice. This con was just too much for him.<br><br>His rude ordeal taught this young man, who had been leading an unremarkable life in North Carolina, that he lived in a new world in which all identities are at risk and, in essence, are in play.<br>I know cons, and right away I saw that this one was going to be the sweetest of all. For the past thirty&#x2013;two years, ever since forsaking my foolish teenage infatuation with perpetrating swindles, I&#x2019;ve been a professional expert in how to prevent fraud. Nearly twenty years ago, as I was busy trying to help banks and businesses stop the spiraling increase in rubber checks and wily embezzlement schemes, it became obvious to me that a brand&#x2013;new fraud, still in its formative stages and without even a clarifying name, was destined to overwhelm all the others as the clear crime of choice. In fact, it was a crook&#x2019;s dream come true, the sort of surefire caper that makes a career criminal glad he ignored his mother&#x2019;s advice and picked the wrong side of the law.<br><br>Years before, I would never have guessed that it could even be invented, for it was the most incredible but also the simplest crime ever perpetrated. And if I manage to live forty more years, it will remain the simplest crime ever committed&#x2014;and the most profitable.<br><br>This festering crime is what we now know as identity theft, the wholesale lifting of someone&#x2019;s identity for illicit gain. It&#x2019;s stealing that identity, then using it to access a person&#x2019;s bank account, their personal information, and their personal finances. It&#x2019;s becoming someone else for the bucks.<br><br>Why did I think it contained such enormous promise for thieves? First of all, it is elementary to pull off. If you have my name, my date of birth, and my Social Security number, that&#x2019;s pretty much all you need in order to become me. It takes very little investment capital. A phone and a cheap computer will get you started. If you want to write phony checks, you&#x2019;ll need a few vital tools like a blow&#x2013;dryer, cake pans, and a common household chemical. You can pick them up at your nearest discount drugstore, and no one will be the wiser.<br><br>Then, the rewards are enormous. Identity theft will afford you access not only to someone&#x2019;s wallet and bank account but to his very life and character, his entire ability to borrow and spend. Are you worried about the law? No need. Technology has made identity theft easy to execute behind the shadowy cloak of a computer keyboard. You don&#x2019;t even have to be in the same city, or country, as your victim. You can steal someone&#x2019;s identity without being able to speak his language or pronounce her name.<br><br>Moreover, law enforcement cares less about identity theft than it does about double&#x2013;parked cars and public loiterers. Your chances of getting caught are minuscule. But even if you do get caught, you are unlikely to spend a single night in jail. Swiping a kid&#x2019;s bike might have graver consequences.<br><br>When I ran all these things through my mind, they unnerved me to no end. And my long&#x2013;dormant criminal instincts stirred a little and made me think, Why didn&#x2019;t they invent this con back when I could have used it?<br><br>When I was passing phony checks in other people&#x2019;s names more than thirty years ago, for example, it took me three months and a million&#x2013;dollar Heidelberg printing press to create and cash a realistic&#x2013;looking product. Today criminals do it in an instant on a $500 computer, with no witnesses to pick them out in a lineup, because they&#x2019;re doing it from an armchair in China or Russia, a continent away. And checks are simply one piece of an identity thief&#x2019;s arsenal.<br><br>In recent years identity theft has become the very monster I feared it would become. It&#x2019;s a crime so versatile that the list of potential targets is endless. Who&#x2019;s at risk? Anyone who has a credit card or a bank account, or who pays a bill. Anyone who has a mortgage, a car loan, or a debit card. Anyone who has a driver&#x2019;s license, a Social Security number, or a job. Anyone who has phone service or health insurance. Anyone who goes on the Internet.<br><br>Even somebody who&#x2019;s always watching his back, like me. People of all ages, all races, all incomes, and both sexes. A thirty&#x2013;five&#x2013;year&#x2013;old New York busboy had the hubris to choose names off the Forbes 400 list, including Ross Perot, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Bloomberg, and Ted Turner, gleaned additional information on them from the Internet, and became them. Robert De Niro&#x2019;s identity was assumed by his movie double. Tiger Woods was victimized by a California man who rented a moving truck and a storage locker in his name. In Chandler, Arizona, the identity of the retired police chief was taken over by a woman who loaded up at Wal&#x2013;Mart and Sam&#x2019;s Club stores. Twin brothers were kicked off the popular <i>American Idol </i>show after police said they had bought a car using the stolen identities of two unwitting fans.<br><br>In other words, anyone who&#x2019;s alive is a potential victim. Actually, I stand corrected&#x2014;even the dead can become targets of this insidious crime. You can have lived your life, then be resting eternally six feet under&#x2014;and you&#x2019;re still not protected from the long reach of identity thieves. Scam artists have no compunction. After all, the dead rarely complain.<br><br>These days you can&#x2019;t go to a party or have lunch with three or four people without someone in that group mentioning that he got a phony e&#x2013;mail, or that his credit card was compromised&#x2014;that somehow someone snatched his identity. Identity theft is the fastest&#x2013;growing criminal activity in the country (and it&#x2019;s doing awfully well abroad). And it could be coming soon to a bank account near you.<br><b>Every Four Seconds</b><br><br>Accurate statistics on identity theft are tricky to come by, because it remains an underdocumented crime. Many people and businesses don&#x2019;t report incidents to the police, and a startling number of people don't even know their identities have been stolen. The reported numbers, though, are shocking.<br><br>At the time when I wrote my last book, <i>The Art of the Steal</i>, in 2001, there were about 750,000 documented victims of identity theft, and losses to banks and credit card companies amounted to $5 billion. That&#x2019;s not chicken feed, but in 2003 the Federal Trade Commission released the most exhaustive government study to date of identity theft, estimating that there had been 27.3 million victims in the prior five years. In 2004 alone, around 10 million consumers suffered from some variation of identity theft, and losses exceeded $54 billion. In 2005 the FTC was swamped with five thousand calls a week relating to the problem, more than they got on any other issue and triple what they had received just five years before.<br><br>When a major insurance company recently polled a sizable sampling of its policyholders on their biggest fears, the number&#x2013;one response was their fear of losing all their assets through bad stock market and other investments. Number two was their fear of identity theft. Throughout the country people go out of their way to put multiple locks on their doors and install costly silent alarm systems. Well, in a given year, about 2.6 percent of Americans have their homes burglarized, but about 4.3 percent of them have their identities stolen. In 2005 it&#x2019;s believed that an identity was stolen every four seconds.<br><br>The crime has universal appeal to criminals, and it&#x2019;s happening all over the world. A recent survey conducted in New Zealand by Baycorp Advantage found that one in ten of the 450 Kiwis questioned said that they had been the victim of identity theft.<br><br>The crime has become so mainstream that comedians have begun joking about it, always a tip&#x2013;off that it&#x2019;s time to worry. Andy Borowitz, a humor columnist, quipped recently that a thief who rounded up a half&#x2013;million identities returned all but four of them because the other 499,996 were &#x201c;totally worthless.&#x201d; Identity thieves, he said, were getting awfully sick of this, feeling it only fair that financial institutions clearly flag deadbeat identities so that crooks don&#x2019;t have to waste their valuable time.<br><br><b><br>I&#x2019;ll Tell You Twenty&#x2013;two Things Overnight</b><br><br>In my entire career I have never encountered a crime as easy to pull off as identity theft. The main reason is that so much personal information is widely and publicly available, there for anyone to take. Once upon a time criminals used to have to really work to make an illegal living. Back when I was passing bad checks, if you wanted to lift information on someone&#x2019;s identity, you had to penetrate so much bureaucracy that it almost wasn&#x2019;t worth the headache. You had to go down to the county records department and try to cadge information, or try to get at boating records and mortgage information by cajoling low&#x2013;level civil service workers. It could be done, but it took know&#x2013;how and talent, plus you had to do it in person, producing witnesses. Now rank amateurs can do it, with technology&#x2019;s helping hand. An identity thief can acquire everything needed to steal your life by going online for less than thirty minutes. If he&#x2019;s in a big rush and has a high&#x2013;speed Internet hookup, fifteen might suffice. Getting someone&#x2019;s supposedly secure information is no harder than downloading a Paris Hilton video.<br><br>I regularly teach agents at the FBI Academy, and one little demonstration I do is to ask one of my students for his address. Nothing more, not even his name. By the following morning I&#x2019;m able to hand over to him twenty&#x2013;two pieces of so&#x2013;called &#x201c;private&#x201d; information about him, including his Social Security number, birth date, salary, current bank and account numbers, mother&#x2019;s maiden name, children&#x2019;s names, spouse&#x2019;s name and Social Security number, and neighbors. I can even reveal who lives with him in his house but isn&#x2019;t related to him. And I don&#x2019;t even have to do something as dramatic as hack into a bank database. All this information is readily available from publicly accessible sources on the Internet, and you or Joe Criminal can get it as easily as I did. Imagine how much I could have found out about the guy if I had decided to break the law!<br><br>Just this past year a friend of mine had his birthday in June, and I wanted to send him a card, but I couldn&#x2019;t remember the exact date. So I logged on to the Web and went to the Texas Public Health Records, because I knew he had been born in Texas, and typed in his name.

Oswald Sanders</p><p></p><h2>Milk and Honey (Decker/Lazarus Novels, 3)</h2><p><p>In the silent pre-dawn city hours -- alone with his thoughts about Rina Lazarus, the woman he loves, three thousand miles away in New York -- LAPD detective Peter Decker finds a small child, abandoned and covered in blood that is not hers. It is a sobering discovery, and a perplexing one, for nobody in the development where she was found steps forward to claim the little girl. Obsessed more deeply by this case than he imagined possible, Decker is determined to follow the scant clues to an answer. But his trail is leading him to a killing ground where four bodies lie still and lifeless. And by the time Rina returns, Peter Decker is already held fast in a sticky mass of hatred, passion, and murder -- in a world where intense sweetness is accompanied by a deadly sting.</p></p><p>Part of my responsiblities as mass market managing editor of Ballantine includes handling reprints. In addition to updating front and back matter in order to keep everything up to date, I make sure that any text changes that need to be made are indeed made. This could include anything from factual information that an author wants to change to simple misspellings (although we pride ourselves in having many books with zero typos). Well, recently I received a letter that had originally been sent from a reader to Faye Kellerman, who sent it on to us. The reader wrote about how much she loves Faye's books, and she was shocked to find a few typos in one of the books. I reviewed her list of "errors," and lo and behold, a couple of them absolutely had to be changed. Whenever a reader does something like this, I like to respond with a letter of my own, along with a copy of the book with the corrections made. But in this case there was only a return address; nowhere was there a name. I looked at the address again; it sounded awful familiar. I searched the remnants of my limited brain and suddenly realized that the letter had come from one of my best friends' mothers. And I could see Mrs. R's style all over it. I immediately called my friend and told him about it; we decided to do nothing until the next reprint comes out, with the corrections. Then I'll send a copy of the book, with a note from me, thanking Mrs. R for all her help. I guess the world gets a little smaller every day. . . .<br><br>Mark Rifkin, Managing Editorial"Faye Kellerman's best novel to date: deeper, richer, more emotionally complex."<br>James Ellroy<br>With his Orthodox Jewish girlfriend, Rina Lazarus, thousands of miles away in New York wrestling with his marriage proposal, it is a lonelier morning than usual when LAPD detective Pete Decker catches something strange in his headlights.

Paul Celan's hermetic, Holocaust-haunted works call out to us and then resort to difficulty, private language, and--in the late art--splintering and silence. Celan, who committed suicide in 1970, was born in Romania and wrote in a German taut with archetypes, archaisms, and neologisms, which has both frustrated and inspired fellow poets and translators. Michael Hamburger has been more daring than most. Laboring on a dual-language selection, he had to resort to biographical clues to unravel entire poems; he bluntly states that "much of Celan's later poetry can be intuitively grasped, but not rendered in another language, without as much knowledge as possible of his sources.... What makes them difficult is the terrain itself--a terrain in which milk is black, death is the all-encompassing reality--not the nature of its charting." <p> The reference is to Celan's most famous work, "Todesfuge" ("Death Fugue"), a poem which grows more harrowing with each reading, particularly the iconic lines "death is a master from Germany his eyes are blue / he strikes you with leaden bullets his aim is true." Hamburger's translation begins: </p><blockquote> Black milk of daybreak we drink it at sundown<br> we drink it at noon and in the morning we drink it at night<br> we drink and we drink it<br> we dig a grave in the breezes there lies one unconfined... </blockquote> Though this is among Celan's more accessible works, most of the poems in Hamburger's volume will reward, and stun, the attentive reader.<b>Paul Celan</b> (1920&#x2013;1970) was born Paul Antschel into a Jewish family in Bukovina, a German enclave in Romania which was destroyed by the Nazis. His parents were taken to a concentration camp in 1942, and did not return; Celan managed to escape deportation and to survive. After settling in Paris in 1948, he gained widespread recognition as a poet with the publication of his first collection of poems in German in 1952. His earliest poems were written in Romanian and have been translated by, among others, his friend Nina Cassian. He was a fine translator of poetry, mainly from French, English, Russian and Romanian. His mysterious meeting with Martin Heidegger was the subject of a radio play by John Banville. <b>Michael Hamburger</b> (1924&#x2013;2007) was a poet and critic of distinction as well as the outstanding translator of German poetry. His awards include the Schlegel-Tieck Prize (1981), the German Federal Republic&#x2019;s Goethe Medal (1986) and the EC&#x2019;s first European Translation Prize (1990) for <i>Poems of Paul Celan</i>. Five collections of his poetry appeared since <i>Collected Poems 1941&#x2013;1994</i>. He also published several collections of essays, the critical study <i>The Truth of Poetry</i>, and an autobiography <i>String of Beginnings</i>. His translations include selections from Celan, Eich, Goethe, Hofmannsthal, H�lderlin, Peter Huchel, Rilke and others.</p><h2>Shadow Magic (Havemercy)</h2><p>Led to victory by its magic-fueled Dragon Corps, Volstov has sent a delegation to its conquered neighbors to work out the long-awaited terms of peace. Among those in the party are the decorated war hero General Alcibiades and the formerly exiled magician Caius Greylace. But even this mismatched pair can&#x2019;t help but notice that their defeated enemies aren&#x2019;t being very cooperative.

They are also the authors of <b>Dragon Soul</b>.<i>Chapter One<br>MAMORU<br></i><br>On the seventh and final day of mourning for the loss of the war, my brother Iseul came to my chambers to tell me that our father was dead.<br><br>I had been expecting the news for some time. There was ritual ensconced in the hour of his death&#x2014;this, on the seventh hour of the seventh day&#x2014;which made it all the more unsurprising to see the truth in my brother's eyes, lining his mouth and hardening his jaw. The news was no shock to us. Our father had taken his life in apology for our defeat at the hands of the Volstovics, as we always knew he would; all we could do now was join him or suffer his legacy. For either of these, we were equally prepared.<br><br>My brother came with black robes and no kohl to line his eyes, rather than with knives of ceremony. I saw then that his decision had been made. In this as in all things, I would follow the path my brother had chosen for us.<br><br>Outside the window, just past the quiet gardens of raked sand and contemplation, loomed the broken roof of the magicians' dome, like the rounded edge of a broken sky as seen from above, where the gods once sat and watched over us in dominion. It was far enough away that it looked almost like a shattered bowl overset, or a forsaken cup of tea dropped by clumsy hands. What remained of the dome was charred. Here and there the blue stone sparkled, but it was no more than feeble protest in the bleaching sunlight.<br><br>The destruction of the dome had been a particularly crushing blow to our people, though perhaps not the one the Volstovics intended. We were not a society based heavily on magic; war had forced our hand in advancing the skill of our magicians. And though in later years the dome became a perfect gathering place for the magicians, it had first been built as a temple of worship for our gods. Its demolition had been a huge blow to the morale of the people, as a symbol more than a practical structure.<br><br>Iseul pushed his fingers through his hair, each heavy braid a commendation of his prowess as our father's general. He was on the verge of pacing, but practice kept him fearsomely still.<br><br>"The delegation arrives tomorrow," he said. "We shall meet them as planned."<br><br>The entire city must have known by then&#x2014;or would soon know&#x2014;of my father the emperor's death. From somewhere deep in the green garden just below my window, I heard the sudden throaty wail of a songbird, trembling upon the air. The sound echoed the faint trembling of my brother's fists, and I averted my eyes.<br><br>The dew had barely left the leaves.<br><br>"We'll meet them as though nothing has changed," I said, with the hint of a question.<br><br>Iseul's eyes flashed in anger. "Nothing has changed," he insisted.<br><br>I sank to my knees before him at once when the look in his eyes betrayed the lie. Everything had changed. Our father was dead and my brother the emperor in his stead, and I had shown grave disrespect to my new lord by neglecting to bow to him; shock had overwhelmed all memory of protocol. I struggled with my shame and could not lift my eyes.<br><br>"Mamoru," Iseul said, in place of how he had once addressed me. Brother. "Do not do this. Rise."<br><br>"I swear to serve you," I said, instead of obeying him. This old custom was more important even than brotherhood. We were no longer two princes, and I had wasted too much time already without acknowledging his new place as emperor of the Ke Han. "In seven ways I shall serve you. In seven ways I shall offer my life to you. In seven ways, if it is in my power, I shall die beneath your blade, as your blade, for your blade. May your reign be prosperous and long." Then, closing my eyes, I strayed from the words I'd known since before I could form them with my own mouth, the prayer with which I was born. "May the people love you as I do," I whispered. "Iseul&#x2014;"<br><br>My brother held up his hand, fingers spread wide. As always, it was a small sign, but the shame I felt was assuaged by the openness of the gesture. If my brother's fingers had been all together, I would have sensed his anger at my actions, but I had never given my brother cause to close his hand and his heart against me.<br><br>"Enough," he said, his voice cold. He must have already been preparing, mentally, for the arrival of the delegates. "Rise."<br><br>I did as he'd bidden me. It was as things would be between us from then on, and it was as things had always been, for I respected my brother's elder position just as I loved him, and it stilled the quaking in my chest a little to know that not everything had changed.<br><br>"What&#x2014;" I held my tongue, breathing the way I'd been taught to hide the uncertainty in my voice, my movements. "What happens now, Iseul?"<br><br>He shook his head, looking out over the gardens as though expecting to find some answer within their soothing patterns. Of course, my brother was a man who needed no such reassurance. I myself felt an unbidden longing. The sand had no need to worry as to what direction to take, what shape, what form. There was a plan in mind for the sand, and it had only to follow. My brother and I had no such luck.<br><br>I fiddled with the smooth, soft fabric of my overlong sleeves, trying not to seem as though I was waiting on my brother's response. Surely the new responsibility was weighing heavily on his mind, and he would have a great many things to discuss with the warlords, our own diplomats, before the delegation from Volstov arrived tomorrow. The proper thing, I knew, was to beg my leave, expecting to be informed of what my new role within the negotiations would be at a later hour, when my brother had taken his time to sort it out. Knowing this, however, did not preclude my stubborn desire to stay nearby. After all, with our father dead, Iseul was all I had of family, and I the same to him&#x2014;for even as the elder prince, my father had not yet seen fit to find my brother a wife. Now he was emperor, but still my brother, and I would not leave until I'd found some sign that I'd not lost him to dark thoughts of what was to come. But he would not look at me.<br><br>"Iseul," I began, and felt reassurance opening like a blossom within me. It seemed then that I knew, from some unseen source of certainty, that everything would be healed in time for my brother and for me. For our people, for all the Ke Han. We would put our heads together, Iseul and I, along with my father's old advisors; and we would manage the task set to us as best we could. I hadn't yet grown past the childish notion that there was nothing we couldn't accomplish together. And indeed, even our father had been proud to claim that Iseul's strengths balanced against mine so fittingly that together we made a nearly invincible pair. Today was going to be onerous for him, and I could not expect reassurances&#x2014;rather it was my place now to reassure him, in his new station, for if I did not support our new emperor with all my being, then what man could be expected to do so?<br>We would find ourselves within this new rhythm once we'd settled into this new way of being. It was only a matter of time.<br><br>My brother's face turned toward mine, and then to the door as Kouje cleared his throat just beyond, filling the silence my brother had left in the wake of my appeals.<br><br>"Your pardon," Iseul said to me, sounding distant somehow, but how could I blame him? He moved with a steadiness of purpose that I longed to imitate, and slid open the door on the kneeling figure before us.<br><br>"My lord Emperor," Kouje began, proving that news traveled faster among the servants than I'd have believed possible, and that my brother's decision was known now throughout the great house, if not the palace proper. "Word has been sent that the delegation from Volstov is set to arrive rather&#x2014;earlier&#x2014;than we anticipated."<br><br>"Earlier," my brother repeated.<br><br>He did not need to phrase it as a question; it was Kouje's duty to anticipate and respond in kind.<br>"We believe they may be here in a matter of hours, your Supreme Grace."<br><br>It was then that I envied Kouje's propriety in keeping his face averted. This way, he did not have to see my brother's expression at that moment, terrible as the gods' fire.<br><br>"Gather the warlords," said my brother, in a voice I didn't recognize. It was a voice that had commanded our warriors in the mountains. "We will hold counsel in the green room."<br><br>Kouje rose, clad all in mourning black. The sight of it seemed to remind my brother of something, for he lifted his hand&#x2014;an emperor making his decision. I scarcely had time to marvel at the completeness of my brother's transformation, as though he'd been living all his life on its cusp.<br><br>"Take the prince to be dressed," Iseul commanded. "The seven days have passed, and the delegation must find us prepared to receive them with all due hospitality."<br><br>Kouje bowed, though not so low as to find himself on the floor once more, and turned to me with a waiting expectation I'd come to know well.<br><br>"Iseul," I said. I was quiet enough, but I found myself unable to keep my silence entirely. It would have been different, in the company of servants, or the other warlords; but before his death Kouje's father had served ours as Kouje did me. While he was not of distinguished blood, he was certainly trustworthy&#x2014;too trustworthy, in fact, for he had forgiven me many an error in decorum over the years. I didn't have my brother's facility in assuming the responsibilities of a prince, nor could I possibly imagine the weight on his shoulders now that he was emperor. Still, we were brothers. I could offer him comfort, if nothing else. "We shall persevere."<br><br>We had no other choice beyond that, save to perish in the attempt. But I left unsaid the second half of the old warrior's idiom, knowing it would only make my brother frown and Kouje regret teaching me such things in the first place.<br><br>"Go with Kouje," said my brother. His voice betrayed nothing but an iron calm that so reminded me of our father that for a moment I was overcome with a sharp awareness of how things were to change between us. "Then . . . return to your chambers. I will send for you."<br><br>I bowed low to my brother, the emperor. Despite his remonstrations to the contrary, it never occurred to me to act in any other way.<br><br>We parted ways without further talk, and I found myself relieved for the silence. My brother never had such troubles as I with keeping his silence or maintaining the peace of his spirit; I was always at war with myself, my father had once said, and it seemed a quality I might never entirely lose.<br>Kouje, too, said nothing. There were no lamps lit, nor were there servants moving swiftly and surely in preparation. The halls seemed like the winding passageways of a warrior's tomb.<br><br>Luckily, there were tasks immediately to hand that would serve as ample distraction from this unfortunate comparison. While Kouje waited just outside the door, I slipped into the silent, hot bath that had been drawn for me, holding my breath as I sank deep inside. The water was hot enough that I felt it might scald all my skin from my bones&#x2014;a clean, new birth.<br><br>I knew with certainty that my brother had been strong enough not to shed a single tear for the father we had both lost&#x2014;and not only our father but our lord emperor as well. He had died the only noble death left for him, and though I mourned the victory for which we had all hoped, I could do nothing more than be a loyal son to him.<br><br>The bath was swift, and the incense already burning when I stepped out. Servants came to dry me, twisting dry the braids of honor in my hair. This, for the victory at Dragon Bone Pass. This, for the victory of the tunnels. This, for the victory of the forsaken men. This, for the victory of the auspicious moon.<br><br>I bore no scars from those battles. I was a general, a second son. I rode no horse, but did the best I could to keep the men serving me from dying. In the later months of the war, when the fighting had grown too fierce for an unexpected general such as me, the council of warlords had recommended my return to the palace. In place of earning more braids, I had attempted to set up facilities of care for those displaced by the war. It was a necessary task, and I took great pleasure in helping those who'd been caught living too closely to the Cobalts, but I was no warrior.<br><br>I imagined that I would always bear the shame of my own shortcomings held against my brother's fiercer nature were it not for something my father said to me, less than a week before the dragons' final assault on the capital.<br><br>"The people's needs are never so simple as they seem," he said, taking his favorite seat in the pavilion, built overlooking the koi pond. "Even I, with two such hands as these, could never hope to meet them all at once. My sons will not suffer with such difficulties. Your brother protects what land we have, while you provide for our subjects. Just as we cannot provide if the land is taken from us, so the protection becomes meaningless if you squander what gifts may be gleaned from it."<br><br>My father had never been one to waste words on meaningless praise. He had never spoken to me thus before, and I sought to memorize his words even as I watched the multicolored fish swarming over and past one another like brightly colored veils, orange and white, blue and gold.<br><br>I had not returned to the pavilion since the assault on our city, but it bolstered my spirit somewhat to know that the fish would remember our conversation. That though I could no longer ask my father for confirmation of his words, there was some creature left who had been witness to them.</p><h2>As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl</h2><p><p>In&nbsp; 1967, after a twin baby boy suffered a botched circumcision, his family agreed to a radical treatment that would alter his gender.&nbsp; The case would become one of the most famous in modern medicine -- and a total failure.&nbsp; <em>As Nature Made Him</em> tells the extraordinary story of David Reimer, who, when finally informed of his medical history, made the decision to live as a male.&nbsp; A macabre tale of medical arrogance, it is first and foremost a human drama of one man's -- and one family's -- amazing survival in the face of terrible odds. </p><br></p><p>Once you begin reading <i>As Nature Made Him</i>, a mesmerizing story of a medical tragedy and its traumatic results, you absolutely won't want to put it down. Following a botched circumcision, a family is convinced to raise their infant son, Bruce, as a girl. They rename the child Brenda and spend the next 14 years trying to transform him into a her. Brenda's childhood reads as one filled with anxiety and loneliness, and her fear and confusion are present on nearly every page concerning her early childhood. Much of her pain is caused by Dr. Money, who is presented as a villainous medical man attempting to coerce an unwilling child to submit to numerous unpleasant treatments.<p> Reading over interviews and reports of decisions made by this doctor, it's difficult to contain anger at the widespread results of his insistence that natural-born gender can be altered with little more than willpower and hormone treatments. The attempts of his parents, twin brother, and extended family to assist Brenda to be happily female are touching--the sense is overwhelmingly of a family wanting to do "right" while being terribly mislead as to what "right" is for her. As Brenda makes the decision to live life as a male (at age 14), she takes the name David and begins the process of reversing the effects of estrogen treatments. David's ultimately successful life--a solid marriage, honest and close family relationships, and his bravery in making his childhood public--bring an uplifting end to his story. Equally fascinating is the latest segment of the longtime nature/nurture controversy, and the interviews of various psychological researchers and practitioners form a larger framework around David's struggle to live as the gender he was meant to be. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><p>John Colapinto has written for <em>Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, Esquire, Mademoiselle, Us Weekly,</em> and <em>Rolling Stone,</em> where the landmark National Magazine Award-winning article that was the basis for <em>As Nature Made Him</em> first appeared.

In Europe, North America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, he finds 60 commanding giants and dwarfs, Methuselahs, shrines, and "dream" trees of many kinds. Whether he is meeting baobabs, sequoias, or banyans, he finds magnificence, beauty, and, sometimes, sadness. He has a genius for communicating his sense of each tree as an individual being, engendering wonder, awe, and respect for it in readers. His thoughtful but brisk narratives bring his travels to life and readers feel that they are participants in an adventure as he experiences trees, their ecological and historical contexts, and the challenges of creating photographs of such difficult and special subjects. And Pakenham's color photographs are truly remarkable as he conveys the tactile aspect of bark, the sense of size or majesty, or the rare moment when the light is just right to capture the spirit of the tree. Chapters are further enhanced with historical illustrations (often, earlier views of the same trees) and snippets of poetry ranging from Alfred, Lord Tennyson to Ogden Nash. Pakenham ends with a chapter on "Trees in Peril." This beautiful and unique book is sure to be appreciated by nature lovers. And though it is a highly personal work and not a scientific text, it demonstrates keen and accurate observation; it could also serve as an excellent supplement to studies in science, history, and geography.<br><i>Christine C.

As the authors state in the preface: "We write this book with two major goals in mind. First, to give people an idea of the sheer size and reach of the NAR movement. And second, to systematize its key teachings and practices and evaluate them on the basis of Scripture and careful reasoning ... . In our judgment, the NAR perspective crosses these boundaries [that is, certain broad parameters, revealed in Scripture and practiced in the historical orthodox church], and it does so in part because of flawed theology rooted in a flawed understanding of Scripture. We wish to warn readers about a possible confusion: Some critics have linked the NAR movement with mainstream Pentecostalism and charismatics. We do not do this. In fact, it is our contention that the NAR movement deviates from classical Pentecostal and charismatic teachings. This movement has emerged out of independent charismatic churches and, thus, has gained a foothold in many of those churches in varying degrees." </p></p><p><p>Holly Pivec holds a master&#x2019;s degree in Christian apologetics from Biola University in La Mirada, California.

Yet, coffeehouses profoundly influenced the creation of modern Jewish culture from the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. With roots stemming from the Ottoman Empire, the coffeehouse and its drinks gained increasing popularity in Europe. The "otherness," and the mix of the national and transnational characteristics of the coffeehouse perhaps explains why many of these caf�s were owned by Jews, why Jews became their most devoted habitu�s, and how caf�s acquired associations with Jewishness. Examining the convergence of caf�s, their urban milieu, and Jewish creativity, Shachar M. Pinsker argues that caf�s anchored a silk road of modern Jewish culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;He uncovers a network of interconnected caf�s that were central to the modern Jewish experience in a time of migration and urbanization, from Odessa, Warsaw, Vienna, and Berlin to New York City and Tel Aviv. <i>A Rich Brew </i>explores the Jewish culture created in these social spaces, drawing on a vivid collection of newspaper articles, memoirs, archival documents, photographs, caricatures, and artwork, as well as stories, novels, and poems in many languages set in caf�s. Pinsker shows how Jewish modernity was born in the caf�, nourished, and sent out into the world by way of print, politics, literature, art, and theater. What was experienced and created in the space of the coffeehouse touched thousands who read, saw, and imbibed a modern culture that redefined what it meant to be a Jew in the world.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></strong></p><p><b>Shachar M.

The green sashes are laid out on the table for his father and two older brothers--all ready for them to sport in the big parade. This is all very exciting, but Jamie's family had told him he was too small to walk in the parade--too young to make it all the way up Acorn Hill. He decides to take matters (and his trusty flute) into his own small hands, and embarks on an early morning walk--all the way up Acorn Hill--with his dog Nell. What did <i>they</i> know? Sure enough, while the village is sleeping, he traverses the parade route to the top of the hill where he greets the sun with a hearty, "A happy St. Pat's to you, sun." And, he makes it home before breakfast! While no one finds out what Jamie has done, you suspect that he may tell his family later.

He's able to switch from psychologist Alan Gregory's point of view to Gregory's ex-wife, Meredith, in a flash. He plays Gregory as understated and somewhat wimpy and Meredith as catty and narcissistic. When their stories come together, we learn that Gregory's ex-wife has asked him to help search for a pregnancy surrogate who has disappeared. Gregory investigates this disappearance and its connection to a woman who vanished in the Grand Canyon years earlier. There's even more to this plot-a terrorist bombing and a missing child.

In transforming himself from a traditional Muslim theologian into the charismatic Iranian ruler who took on the world, Khomeini launched an Islamic revival movement that, with the collapse of communism, quickly evolved for some as the centre-piece in the pantheon of western demonology, and for others as the inspiration for spiritual and political rebirth. Whether viewed as a hero by his supporters or as a villain by his enemies, Khomeini was undoubtedly one of the seminal figures of the twentieth century, whose influence will extend some way into the new millennium. <br><br>Baqer Moin here explores how and why this frail octogenarian, dressed in the traditional robes of a Muslim cleric, overthrew the secular Shah of Iran and became the spiritual leader of a new and militant Islamic regime. Still an enigma in the West, Khomeini transformed the Middle East and the world. But where did the man come from? What was his childhood and family background? What lay behind his implacable opposition to the Shah? What role did the turbulent events in Iran during his youth play in shaping Khomeini's political perceptions? What changed him from an obscure traditional theologian with mystical and poetic inclinations into a combative and highly vengeful radical? How will his vision of an international community of Muslims, a kind of Islamic Internationale, affect the Middle East?<br><br>Drawing on many exclusive personal interviews with Khomeini's associates, on unpublished new materials and on the author's firsthand experience in Islamic seminaries, this biography provides a fascinating, well-documented and highly accessible analysis of the life and thought of one of the most controversial leaders of the late twentieth century.<br></p><p>Baqer Moin is a specialist on Iran and Islam and is Head of the BBC's Persian Service. He was born into a religious family and studied theology at traditional schools in Iran's most important shrine city, Mashhad. He has written extensively on Islam, Iran and Afghanistan.<br>Moin has produced the first serious and accessible examination of the ayatollah's life. -- <i><i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Elaine Sciolino</i></p><h2>Don&#39;t Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It&#39;s Raining</h2><p>How many mornings have you opened the newspaper only to read about another violent crime committed by a juvenile? Are you outraged when the "rights" of a criminal take precedence over the rights of the victim? Do you ever feel that people should start taking responsibility for their own actions and stop using the rest of society as the scapegoat? <p>Judy Sheindlin knows these feelings all too well. After more than two decades serving in New York City's family court system, she has seen, heard and now she shares it all in<strong> </strong><em>Don't Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It's Raining</em>. </p><p>The time for change was yesterday and the time to wake up is now. The problems Sheindlin encounters daily -- welfare abuse, juvenile violence, abandoned or abused children, ugly custody fights -- reflect the growing destruction of America's families. They are a mirror of what has gone wrong in America; a reflection of how far we have strayed from personal responsibility and old-fashioned discipline. </p><p>Rich in courtroom detail, with eye-opening expos,s of government stupidities and legal chicanery, <em>Don't Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It's Raining</em> tells tales from the dark side of human nature. You will encounter welfare deadbeats who rip off the system and duck an honest day's work -- until Sheindlin cracks the whip, forcing them to find jobs. You will learn about a beautiful teenage girl who was murdered on her way home from school by other girls for a pair of earrings. You will meet a subway mugger who became a millionaire by suing the police who arrested him. </p><p>A fiercely intelligent, flamboyant, tough-talking mother of five, Sheindlin examines the problem of America's fraying family fabric and says publicly what most citizens feel privately: Juvenile delinquency is out of control and young criminals must not be treated lightly by the court system any longer. Ultimately Sheindlin says that the answer to most of society's problems can be summed up in one word -- Responsibility. "Society must demand that people grow up and accept responsibility," she writes. "The folks who insist that we continue to tolerate abuse by self-described victims should get the message -- not anymore."</p></p><p>Judge Judy Sheindlin established herself as a tough but fair judge in New York's family court. She is the presiding judge for <em>Judge Judy,</em> a nationally syndicated daily television show based on real court cases, and the author of two best-selling adult books and a children's book. She lives in New York City with her husband, Jerry, a New York Supreme Court Judge. She is the mother of five and a grandmother of four.As a New York City prosecutor and judge, Sheindlin has spent more than 20 years in court with juveniles, both delinquents and objects of delinquency, and parents and custodians who are, lamentably often, delinquent themselves. With <i>Los Angeles Times</i>' correspondent Getlin's able help, she shapes the lessons of her experience into an argument in 10 punches. Each of the 10 is a chapter made up of anecdotal evidence of the abuse of crime and civil-procedural victims, not just by their assailants but by social welfare systems that also victimize taxpayers because of their exorbitant costliness. Besides decrying particular scams and abuses (bad foster care, child custody battles, judges who decide on political rather than human considerations, private social service providers who fleece public funds, miscreants who claim they themselves are victims, etc.), Sheindlin sees American society as having got offtrack. The answer to the messes of urban crime and welfare dependency, she claims, is "self-discipline, individual accountability and responsible conduct." Demand that people behave and make the consequences of misbehavior onerous, she says, and good behavior is surer to follow than if offenders continue to be treated as if they were greater victims than their prey. An old song, you may say, but seldom has it been as powerfully sung. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>A Tear and a Smile</h2><p>Contains 56 parables, stories, and poems in Gibran&#39;s wholly inimitable manner.

This book contains his one pre-Gateway Heechee story, the novella "The Merchants of Venus," and nine short entries under such titles as "The Gateway Asteroid," "The Starseekers" and "Other Worlds" that provide background on the characters and settings of the Heechee novels. The narrator of the novella , Audee Walthers, makes his living on Venus by showing tourists around the Heechee ruins, abandoned 500,000 years earlier. He hopes that wealthy, surly Boyce Cochenour will pay him enough to provide for surgery to replace his failing liver. There's only one problem, an ethical one: Cochenour wants to dig for illegal artifacts. The story has the zip and humor of vintage Pohl. The short pieces that comprise the rest of the volume are not narratives but glossings on the Heechee novels. Although Pohl is careful not to give away plot elements of those books, at the same time he presents new details to enhance that universe for familiar readers. Still, it would be preferable to read the novels first.

As a nine year-old child, Abraham found himself orphaned as civil war in his homeland of Sudan ravaged his entire village because they refused to embrace Islam. His journey is one of a perilous walk along with 35,000 lost boys of Sudan who fled to Ethiopia. Abraham and others like him made it to the border but hard times were not over as he endured the refugee camps of Ethiopia. Abraham becomes a lost boy no more when he discovers real salvation through Jesus Christ. Lost Boy No More gives more than a narrative of Abraham&#x2019;s story. It also gives a history of Sudan and the persecution of Christians by Islamic militants.</p><p>Nhial survived the unthinkable. Rebels attacked his village in southern Sudan in 1987, killing many dear to him. He ran into the jungle, meeting other "Lost Boys" and wandering with them for months, and survived by eating wild plants and even mud. He watched some of his companions attacked by lions and daily feared for his life. The Lost Boys&#x2014;35,000 of them&#x2014;found safety first in Ethiopia, and when attacked there moved on to Kenya, losing a great deal of their number in their escape across the Gilo River, where they were attacked by crocodiles, shot or drowned. Eventually, Nhial was one of the 4,000 relocated to the United States. He and the others dream of going back to rebuild Sudan into a peaceful and prosperous country. Nhial's story is told third-person, in Mills's voice, which drains its power. Numerous chapters in the middle of the book get weighed down with studies of Sudanese history, a comparison of Islam and Christianity (Nhial's own faith), details on the development of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, life in a refugee camp and the history of oil resources and slavery in southern Sudan. These facts are relevant, but they stop the progression of the story. The story is a page-turner; unfortunately, the book is not. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Libby Norstad's deep brown eyes sparkled in its light. "We got away!" she whispered to Caleb. "We really got away!" <br> To Libby it seemed a miracle. For the past two days and nights, they had faced constant danger. <br> Caleb Whitney's blond hair fell over his forehead, nearly reaching his eyes. He grinned at Libby, then glanced up at the hills of Burlington, Iowa. The steamboat owned by Libby's father lay at the landing. While deckhands brought in the gangplank, Caleb kept watch. <br> Now, late at night, the streets looked empty, yet Libby knew that Caleb was searching for someone. Near the riverfront, the windows of tall warehouses seemed like dark eyes staring down at them. <br> With three quick blasts of the whistle, the <i>Christina</i> put out into the Mississippi River. As the strip of water between the land and boat grew wide, Libby felt relieved. In spite of all kinds of danger, they had escaped! <br> Just then Libby felt a movement behind her. As she turned, she saw Jordan Parker creeping forward without a sound. When he drew close to the lantern, he stopped, as if afraid to enter the circle of light. <br> A fugitive slave, Jordan had managed to get away from his master, a cruel slave trader named Riggs. Like Caleb, Jordan also stared up at the city. On the streets above them no one stirred. Then a dark shape stepped out from the shadow of a warehouse. <br> Jordan moaned. "It's Riggs!" <br> With one quick movement, Caleb lifted the glass of the lantern and blew out the flame. Libby dropped down on her hands and knees, but it was too late. <br> "Riggs knows," she whispered as Caleb joined her behind piles of freight. "He saw you." <br> "He saw you too," Caleb warned, his voice low. <br> A feeling of dread tightened Libby's stomach. "What should we do?" <br> Caleb shushed her. "Sound carries on water." <br> A short distance out from shore, the <i>Christina</i> started to turn. As her bow swung around to face downstream, Libby stared at the man next to the warehouse. Then the center of the boat blocked her view. <br> "How long was Riggs there?" she whispered. "How much did he see?" <br> "Too much," Caleb told her. At thirteen, he was a year older than Libby. Now Caleb led her and Jordan to a place at the front of the boat where no one could hear them talk. <br> When the boys dropped down on crates, Libby found a nail keg to sit on. "You're sure it was Riggs?" she asked. It had been too dark to see the man's face, and she wanted to believe they were wrong. According to Caleb, Riggs was the cruelest man he knew. <br> "It were Riggs, all right." Jordan's voice held no doubt. "He gots one shape-and I knows it!" <br> "But he could have stayed hidden," Libby answered. "Why did he step out so we could see him?" <br> "That man <i>wants</i> us to know he's on our trail," Jordan said. "He wants to scare us any way he can." <br> In the darkness Libby shivered. As long as the slave trader searched for him, Jordan would never be safe. Libby didn't like being frightened by the sight of Riggs, but deep inside she trembled just thinking about him. <br> Then she remembered. "Jordan, you weren't in the light. Maybe Riggs doesn't know that you're with us." <br> Jordan sighed. "I wish you was right, Libby. That man Riggs is like a bloodhound on my trail. When he sniffs out Caleb, he sniffs out me." <br> Since the age of nine, Caleb had worked on the Underground Railroad, the secret plan to help runaway slaves reach freedom. Once fugitives started on the secret route, they usually kept moving if it was safe. Instead, for special reasons Jordan would stay on the <i>Christina</i>. <br> "What's wrong?" Caleb asked Libby, as though sensing her worry. <br> "N-n-nothing!" Libby hated the sound of her voice. "Nothing at all!" If she told Caleb what bothered her, he would think she was a scaredy-cat. Instead, Libby tried to push her fear away. <br> <i>I want to have courage</i>, she thought. <i>Courage like Caleb and Jordan</i>. <br> On that March night in 1857, Libby knew the penalty to anyone who helped runaway slaves on their race to freedom. According to law, slave hunters could follow fugitives into free states. There they could gather a posse and bring runaways back to their owners. <br> Leaning closer, Caleb peered into Libby's face. When she tried to hide her feelings, the light of the moon gave her away. "You're scared," Caleb said. "You're scared that Riggs will come on board and find Jordan." <br> "Well, doesn't that frighten you?" Libby asked. <br> "Nope," Caleb answered. <br> "What do you mean, <i>nope</i>? Pa is captain of this boat and owner too. Don't you care that he could be arrested for hiding a runaway slave?" <br> "Of course I care!" <br> "You don't sound like it!" Libby felt upset now. "You know what would happen if Riggs found Jordan on the <i>Christina</i>. It's the law of the land that Pa could be found guilty for hiding a fugitive. He'd have to pay a big fine!" <br> "Is that all you're worried about?" Caleb asked. "The fines? The money?" <br> Libby stared at him. "What if Pa can't pay the fines? He would lose the <i>Christina</i>!" <br> "Yup! He would." Caleb didn't sound too upset. <br> "What's worse, Pa could go to jail! Wouldn't you be scared if the captain were your father?" <br> Caleb sat with his back to the moon. Darkness shadowed his face, but Libby saw the shake of his head. "There's something that bothers me a whole lot more," he said. <br> "What's that?" Libby asked. More than once she had found it hard to understand this strange boy. <br> "What could be worse than Pa going to jail?"</p><h2>Imperial Purple</h2><p>Set in early Christian times, the tale of the weaver Demetrias portrays her entrapment in a treasonous plot against the Byzantine emperor and her fight to protect her family and self as the battle for Constantinople rages</p><p>Bradshaw ( Beekeeper's Daughter and Beacon at Alexandria ) creates a compelling fictional character, Demetrias. Wife and mother, well-born slave, she is the premier silk weaver working in fifth century Tyre, where life and commerce revolve around the precious purple dye that symbolizes the power of imperial Rome. When Demetrias is assigned to weave a cloak in the proscribed imperial color, but not of measurements to fit Emperor Theodosius II, she realizes that treachery is afoot, but refusal is not a slave's option. Her survival depends on devising a strategy to save her life and those of her family. The plot twists and turns through a diorama of actual events involving historical figures, notably Demetrias's encounter with the emperor's formidable sister, Pulcheria. Historical novels are stamped by both the writer and the backdrop of an era; Imperial Purple is doubly embossed with strength in a style that will appeal to readers of Robert Graves and Mary Renault. The author's historical afterword further illuminates the turbulent Byzantine era. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA Continuing her work on historical motifs, Bradshaw brings readers a third novel set in the Byzantine period. The fascinating theme throughout this tale is the manufacture of purple dye from murex shellfish and the weaving of sumptuous gownsthe purple cloth valued above gold and worn only by emperors. The slave Demetrias, a talented silk weaver, is instructed to weave a cloak of imperial purple. She and her husband, a murex fisherman, are drawn into a treacherous plot which gives drama to the lives of slaves, eunuchs, and rulers. Endpaper maps show Tyre and Constantinople in the 5th Century a.d. In a concluding statement, Bradshaw provides information about actual people and facts used and those invented for the enrichment of the tales.

The March winds whipped against the pickup as she hurried toward Twin Canyons Ranch, thirty-four miles south of Promise, Texas. <br> <br>Her mother-in-law was with the children, but Jeremy and Emma would have difficulty getting the animals into the barn without help. Ruth would do what she could, but the older woman's heart wasn't strong and� Nell didn't want to think what might happen if she didn't make it back in time. <br> <br>Her life had been on a fast-moving treadmill for the past three years, ever since her husband died in a tractor accident. Storms were the least of her worries, considering the financial challenges she'd faced working the ranch without Jake. Not a day passed that her husband wasn't in her thoughts. Twenty years from now, <i>forty</i> years from now, he'd still be a part of her. <br> <br>Ruth and others had encouraged her to remarry, at least to date, but Nell had resisted. She never expected to love again�not the way she loved Jake. Their love was the kind that happened only once in a lifetime, and no other man could compare to her Jake. <br> <br>Nell had always known she wasn't any candidate for homecoming queen, but Jake had made her feel like one. He'd understood what it was to be big-boned and just plain big. Dainty or elegant would never describe her; at six feet, Nell was as tall as most men. Jake had been six feet four inches by the time he was a high-school freshman, and the only boy in school taller than Nell. <br> <br>They'd lived in the same town all their lives, but it wasn't until high school that she'd noticed him. The very first day of high school, as a matter of fact. She was a freshman to his senior, and the minute his eyes met hers as she walked down the hall, she knew she'd found her life's mate. He was the only boy she'd ever dated. When he enlisted in the army and became an Airborne Ranger, she'd written him every day. He served his time in the army and was discharged a week after her graduation. Despite her family's protests, she'd married Jake while still a teenager. <br> <br>Neither was to know that ten years was all the time they'd have together. It was Nell who'd found her husband trapped beneath the tractor, Nell who'd held him in her arms as the life flowed out of him, Nell who'd screamed in anguish, helpless to do anything to save her husband's life. <br> <br>Now it was Nell who struggled to hold on to Twin Canyons Ranch, tended what remained of the herd, raised their children and cared for Jake's aging mother. The ranch had been Jake's dream�and hers; it was a small spread that they'd bought together, shortly after their marriage. But she was so very tired, weary to the bone with her financial struggles and other worries. The past three years had drained her mentally, emotionally and physically. For that reason she'd sold off most of the herd and started a new venture. A dude ranch. <br> <br>Bless Jeremy's heart. Her son had been the one to give her the idea. Last year, she'd promised him a reward for acing his spelling test and he'd chosen to rent a movie. Of all the movies available, he'd picked <i>City Slickers,</i> and to Nell it was like a revelation. <br> <br>After seeing the movie, Nell hadn't been able to sleep all night. She was certainly familiar with dude ranches, but it had never occurred to her that this might be a solution to her own dilemma. She couldn't say she understood it, but people actually paid for the opportunity to eat food cooked in a chuck wagon, ride around on horses and drive cattle. Why these people would prefer to live in primitive circumstances when they could experience the luxury of some fancy resort for basically the same price was beyond her. Apparently she had a lot to learn�but learn she did. After months of research Nell was convinced that a dude ranch really was the answer. With a portion of her profits from the sale of last year's herd, she'd had brochures printed and she'd contacted several travel companies. Now she was almost ready for business, and in a couple of months she'd be entertaining her first bunkhouse full of greenhorns. <br> <br>In many ways she was a natural for this kind of work. After these few years without Jake, there wasn't a ranching chore she couldn't accomplish with the speed and dexterity of a man. At this point, she knew as much about ranching as any cowboy. Not only that, she'd heard the great stories of Texas all her life�stories about the state's settlement and the Alamo and the early cattle drives and many more. She'd always loved those stories, and if she could make money telling them now, romanticizing the Old West, all the better. <br> <br>Heavy black clouds darkened the sky. Pushing thoughts of Jake from her mind, Nell focused her attention on the highway. Driving well above the speed limit, she rounded a turn in the road and saw a sports utility vehicle parked along the side. <br> <br>Some damn fool had stopped to take pictures of the approaching storm. The man obviously wasn't a local. Anyone from Texas would know to take cover, and fast. Like the state of Texas itself, storms tended to make an impression, especially spring storms like this one. <br> <br>Despite her hurry, Nell applied her brakes and pulled over. With the engine running, she leaped down from the cab. The wind slapped her long braid against her face as she raced toward the stranger. <br> <br>The greenhorn lowered his camera. "Howdy," he greeted her cheerfully. He was taller than she was and clean-cut. His clothes were new-looking but rumpled. <br> <br>"Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but any idiot knows to head for cover in a storm." <br> <br>His smile faded to a frown. <br> <br>"I don't know where you're from or where you're going," she went on, "but if I were you I'd get my butt back into that fancy car of yours and drive into town as fast as those tires will take you." Having done her duty, she started back to her truck. <br> <br>"Hey," he said, "Got a minute? I have a few questions." <br> <br>"I have to go." Nell didn't mean to sound abrupt, but she didn't have time to waste. She'd said her piece and whether or not he took her advice was completely up to him. <br> <br>"Are you from around the area?" he called after her. <br> <br>"Yes! Now listen, we get hail the size of golf balls and if you don't want to pay to have the dents removed, then I suggest you make tracks for town." <br> <br>"This will only take a minute�" <br> <br>"I don't <i>have</i> a minute, I've got horses and calves to worry about," Nell shouted into the wind. "And I don't have time to convince you a storm is about to break." She raised her hand toward the threatening sky. "It's going to cost you plenty if you don't get that vehicle under cover." <br> <br>"I'm insured." <br> <br>"Hail is an act of God." Whether he caught her last words or not she didn't know. Nell leaped into her truck and put the pickup in gear. One glance in the rear-view mirror proved that giving this stranger advice had been a wasted effort. He hadn't moved. Furthermore, he wasn't snapping pictures of the dark horizon anymore; he was taking pictures of her! <br> <br>Shaking her head in wonder, Nell dismissed him from her thoughts, and drove home at breakneck speed. <br> <br>When she pulled into the ranch yard, she saw Jeremy chasing chickens in a futile attempt to lure them into the coop. Emma and Ruth led the horses toward the barn, yanking on the reins as the two geldings battled the wind. The scene right before the tornado in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> flashed through Nell's mind. <br> <br>She parked the truck near the barn, where it would be protected, and hurried toward her family. With her help, Ruth and Emma managed to secure the animals before the storm broke. <br> <br>By the time they scurried into the house, the rain had started and they were breathless and excited. <br> <br>"We did it!" Twelve-year-old Jeremy said, exchanging a high five with his sister. Unlike most siblings, Jeremy and Emma rarely fought. Sure, they squabbled now and then�all kids did�but these two were close in age and temperament. They'd also been through the devastating experience of their father's death, which had created a strong bond between them. <br> <br>Jeremy was large for his age, like his father and Nell, too�big-boned, muscular and tall. Two years younger, Emma was small and delicate, resembling Ruth, her grandmother. <br> <br>"I'm glad you made it home in time," Ruth said, pouring Nell a cup of hot tea before filling a second cup for herself. <br> <br>Nell gazed out the kitchen window at the ferocity of the storm. The wind propelled the rain at an almost horizontal angle, pelting the trees and flowers. Smaller trees were bent nearly in half. Many a new crop would see ruin this afternoon. <br> <br>Sighing, she turned away from the window. "I would have been a couple of minutes earlier if it hadn't been for some greenhorn," she said. "The silly fool stopped at the side of the road to take pictures." <br> <br>"Anyone you recognized?" Ruth asked. <br> <br>"Never saw him before in my life." Nell would have remembered him if she had. He was big like Jake, sturdy and broad-shouldered. Unfortunately�unlike Jake�he didn't seem to possess an ounce of common sense. <br> <br>Ruth shook her head. "Probably one of those tornado chasers." <br> <br>Nell frowned. "I don't think so." He wasn't the type. Too soft, she decided, and although it might sound unkind, not all that bright. Anyone with brains knew to seek shelter in a storm. <br> <br>"What's for dinner?" Jeremy asked. <br> <br>"Not chili," Emma pleaded. <br> <br>Despite herself Nell laughed. "Not chili," she assured her. Her family had been good sports, sampling different variations of her chili recipe for the past few months. Nell was perfecting her recipe and had used her family as taste-testers. <br> <br>The Chili Cook-off was being held that weekend as part of the Promise Rodeo. These festivities launched spring the way the big Cattlemen's Association dance in June signaled the beginning of summer. <br> <br>Nell held high hopes that her chili might actually win this year. Her talents in the kitchen were legendary, and she believed she made a great pot of chili. For weeks she'd been combining recipes, adding this, subtracting that. After feeding her family chili twice a week, she was finally satisfied with her recipe. <br> <br>"Are you going to win the cook-off?" Emma asked. <br> <br>"Of course she is," Ruth answered before Nell could respond. "I don't see why she shouldn't, seeing she's the best cook this side of the Rio Grande." <br> <br>Both children nodded enthusiastically, and Nell smiled. "How about porcupine meatballs for dinner?" she suggested. The meatballs, made with rice and cooked in tomato soup, were one of the children's favorites. Jeremy and Emma instantly agreed. <br> <br>"I'll peel the potatoes," Ruth said. As usual her mother-in-law was willing to lend a hand. <br> <br>The lights flickered just then, and the house went dark. <br> <br>"That's okay," Jeremy said. "We don't need electricity. We can roast weenies in the fireplace, can't we?" <br> <br>"Yeah," Emma seconded. "We could have hot dogs." <br> <br>"Sounds like a good idea to me." Nell reached for a candle, grateful her children maintained a sense of adventure. They were going to need it when the first dude ranch guests arrived. <br> <br>Cal Patterson shook the moisture from his jacket as he stepped inside out of the driving rain. He removed his Stetson and placed it on the hook just inside the porch to dry. He'd done what he could to protect his herd, gotten his horses into the barn and battened down the shutters where he could. Glen, his brother and business partner, had left for town early in hopes of beating the storm. Cal had worked alone, listening with half an ear for his wife's arrival. He didn't like the idea of Jane driving all the way from town in this kind of weather. <br> <br>"Cal, is that you?" <br> <br>His heart rate accelerated at the sound of her voice. "Jane? What the hell are you doing here? Where's your car? I didn't see it." <br> <br>"I live here, remember?" she teased, joining him in the kitchen porch while he removed his boots. She'd obviously just had a bath and now wore a flannel bathrobe, belted loosely about her waist. "And I didn't park in my usual place because Glen's truck was still there." <br> <br>"You should've stayed in town," he chastised, but he was delighted she'd managed to make it home. He didn't relish the idea of a night spent without her. Two months of marriage, and he'd grown accustomed to sharing his home and his heart with this woman. <br> <br>"The clinic closed early," she informed him, "and I've got my beeper. Anyone can reach me in case of a medical emergency." <br> <br>Cal shed his jacket and slipped his arms around her waist, pulling her close and urging her into the kitchen. His wife was the town's only physician, so there were constant demands on her time. "I don't know if I'll ever be able to stop worrying about you." <br> <br>"Hey, I'm a big girl." <br> <br>"Sure you are!" He was about to kiss her when the lights went out. Not that he minded. A romantic interlude wasn't unwelcome. <br> <br>"I've got a fire going in the fireplace," she whispered, pressing against him, reminding him of the benefits of married life. She looped her arms around his neck and kissed his jaw. <br> <br>Cal shut his eyes and inhaled her fresh sweet scent. This was about as close to heaven as he expected to get in his lifetime. "I don't suppose you're wearing that see-through nightie of yours?" <br> <br>"No," she said, "but that could be arranged." <br> <br>"Now you're talkin'." <br> <br>Cal felt her smile against his skin. "I love you, Rebel." <br> <br>Growling, he swung her into his arms and carried her into the living room. Sure enough, a small fire flickered in the fireplace. This had become their favorite room; he'd lost count of the number of times they'd made love in front of the fireplace. The room had a special significance for him, since it was here that he'd first realized how much he'd come to care about her. It was here in this very room that Dr. Texas, as he was fond of calling her, had taken his freeze-dried heart and breathed life into his lonely existence. <br> <br>Cal was happier than he'd ever thought possible. With each passing day he loved Jane more. Their love had demanded plenty of adjustments on both sides. Sacrifices. But for everything he'd given up, he'd gained so much more. <br> <br>The storm raged outside and a fair one was building on the living-room carpet when Jane's beeper went off. <br> <br>Cal groaned and rolled onto his back, inhaling several deep breaths. "That damn well better be important," he muttered. <br> <br>"Cal!" <br> <br>"I want someone <i>real</i> sick." <br> <br>Giggling, Jane scrambled for her beeper and read the message. "It's Laredo Smith," she said. <br> <br>"Wanna bet he's phoning about Savannah?" <br> <br>"She's just over eigh...</p><h2>Beethoven (Famous Children Series)</h2><p>As part of the &#34;Famous Children Series,&#34; this delightful story recounts episodes from the childhood of Beethoven.

I kicked at the battery...nothing. The heavy Lexan nose cone of the Abyss Glider sank, bobbing upside-down along the surface like a cork. Staring into the depths of the Monterey Bay Canyon, I saw the female's conical head appear from the shadows, her ghostly albino glow paralyzing me in fear as she charged.<br>Her hideous mouth yawned open, anticipating her next meal--me!<br>The thought of this enraged me. Reaching forward, I grabbed the emergency lever and turned it counterclockwise, then yanked it back, igniting the mini-sub's fuel. Instantly, my body was slammed backward within the pod's safety harness as the mini-sub rocketed downward like a torpedo into the awaiting gullet of my worst nightmare--<br>* * *<br>The telephone rings, shattering his concentration. Jonas Taylor grabs the cursed instrument off its cradle, strangling the receiver in his grip. "What?"<br>"Uh...Mr. Taylor?"<br>"Speaking."<br>"Sir, this is Ross Colombo."<br>"I don't know any Ross Colombo."<br>"With American Express. We spoke last week."<br><i>Christ</i>...<br>"Sir, we still haven't received the payment, the one you assured me you had mailed."<br>Jonas's blood pressure ticks a few notches higher. "Look, Russ--"<br>"Ross. Sir, did you send the check?"<br>"Sure, I sent it. Can't believe you haven't gotten it yet. Tell you what, call me next week if it still hasn't arrived."<br>"Could you tell me the check number?"<br>"My wife handles all that stuff and she's not home. Why don't you call her next week."<br>Jonas slams the phone on its receiver, causing the taser-like star pattern of his screen saver to evaporate back into text. <i>Damn bill collectors</i>...<br>He takes a deep breath. Stares at his computer monitor.<br>Writing his memoirs had been Terry's idea. To Jonas, it seemed like a waste of time, a last desperate attempt to regain lost years of fame. Still, he had to make a living, and his once overflowing well of requests for speaking engagements had run dry long ago.<br><i>Face it, Jonas, you're a has-been--yesterday's news.

Almost sixty-four, he was at an age when most men were thinking about retirement, yet here he was, still struggling to make ends meet.<br>He glances at the stack of bills, becoming more depressed.<br><i>Snap out of it, you big baby.

Health insurance, car insurance, mortgage payments, phone bills, electric bills...every month the mountain of debt gets higher, every waking moment dominated by stress. He has borrowed against the house, maxed out his credit cards, dipped into the kids' college funds...and still the mountain grows, along with his pessimism about the future and his constant fear of poverty.<br>Jonas Taylor can't remember the last time he has laughed out loud. Or even smiled.<br>His eyes focus upon the top statement in the stack, his annual life insurance bill--the irony of his life. <i>Bankrupt in life, rich in death. At least you married a younger woman. Yep, Terry will be well taken care of after you croak</i>.<br>"Shut-up!"<br>He tosses the bill aside, then massages his temples, praying the spot in his vision is just the sun's glare on his monitor and not another migraine.<br><i>Stay focused.

When I awoke, I was startled to be alive.

Molten blubber. The upper torso of my former Naval commander--<br>* * *<br>The heavy bass of gangsta rap pounds through the ceiling above his head.<br>Jonas stops typing. Looks up.<br>"Dani?"<br>No response.<br>"Crap."<br>Jonas gets up from his desk. Walks to the staircase. "Danielle Kaye Taylor!"<br>No response.<br>Jonas's blood pressure creeps up another notch. Cursing beneath his breath, he climbs the worn beige-carpeted steps two at a time, turns right at the landing, then trudges down the hall to his daughter's room. Tries the handle. <i>Locked, of course</i>. Pounds on the door. Pounds again.<br>The door opens.<br>"What?" The blond-haired seventeen-year-old stares back at her father, her indigo-blue eyes furious.<br>"I'm trying to work."<br>"So? I live here, too."<br>"Can you just turn it down a bit?"<br>She lowers the volume, just enough so Jonas can comprehend the lyrics. "Geez, Dani, do you have to listen to that crap?"<br>"Dad, don't start--"<br>"A song about three brothers gang-raping their mother?"<br>"It's just a song."<br>"Well I don't like it. Turn it off."<br>"Excuse me, but you can't tell me what to listen to. This happens to be a free country."<br>"The only thing free is what you're paying in rent.

"Another seven weeks and I'll turn eighteen, then I am so out of here."<br>"Better hope financial aid comes through, or you'll be commuting."<br>"News flash: I'm not going to college."<br>His blood pressure tweaks again, his daughter's expression fueling his rage. "And exactly what're you going to do to make a living? Waitress? Flip burgers?"<br>"Maybe I'll write my memoirs!" She slams the door in her father's face.<br><i>Okay, good comeback</i>. He pauses. Hears her crying. <i>So much for my Father-of-the-Year Award</i>...<br>Seeking absolution, he turns and knocks on his son's door. Opens it.<br>The fourteen-year-old with the mop of brownish-red hair poking out from beneath the Philadelphia Phillies baseball cap never looks up, too absorbed in his video game.<br>"David?"<br>"I already did my homework."<br>He kneels beside his son. Watches the boy's hands adeptly work the controls--a replica of his old mini-sub.<br>On screen, the blunt ivory nose of the Megalodon rises, its jaws chomping down upon the fluke of a fleeing Killer Whale. Crimson blood pours from the wound, dispersing across the animation like smoke from a chimney.<br>ORCA. MORTAL WOUND: 250 POINTS. CONTINUE FEEDING.<br>"Why do you always control the Meg? Why not the mini-sub?"<br>"Angel's more fun."<br>The image of a torpedo-shaped mini-sub soars by. David manipulates the controls, sending the Megalodon after it.<br>"You like stalking your old man, huh?"<br>"It's a thousand points."<br>"A thousand points. Be sure to engrave that on my tombstone, will you?"<br>"Shh!"<br>Jonas ignores the impulse to shut off the cursed video game, a reminder of a life that could have been. <i>Endorsements, merchandising...all gone</i>.<br>Gone with his youth.<br>He turns and leaves. Pauses again at Dani's door. Hears her talking on the phone, complaining about her life in some adolescent code.<br><i>The illusion of parenthood</i>...<br>The front door opens. "Jonas?"<br>He heads downstairs. Greets his wife with, "Where have you been? I've been trying to get you on your cell phone for hours."<br>"I told you, the phone company disconnected me yesterday." Terry Taylor's long onyx hair is pulled up in a tight bun, accenting her Asian features. In her mid-forties, she is still quite the beauty. "How come you're not working?"<br>"I can't work in this house, all I get is constant interruptions."<br>"Since you're not working, can you get the groceries out of the car?"<br>Jonas sighs. Heads outside to the SUV in his stocking feet. Gathers as many plastic bags from the open rear hatch as he can handle, then glances at the car parked next to his wife's.<br>Notices the dent in the hood.<br>Registers the twinge in his left arm.<br>Jonas drops the groceries and examines the hood, which no longer seals shut.<br><i>Just keeps getting better and better</i>.<br>"Terry!"<br>She pokes her head out the front door. "What're you screaming about?"<br>"Did you see the hood of the Chrysler?"<br>"I saw it. She said it happened last night while she was parked."<br>"Where did she park? A demolition derby? Damn car costs us two-fifty a month, plus another three grand a year for insurance. You'd think she could be a little more careful--"<br>"Jonas, calm down."<br>"A little appreciation, a little respect, that's all I ask." Blood boiling, he opens the front door of his daughter's car. Snarls at the heavy scent of tobacco. Reaches down to pop the hood and spots the bag of marijuana, hidden beneath the seat.<br>&nbsp;"Terry!" <br>--as the migraine squeezes tighter behind his eyeball.<br>&nbsp;<br>TANAKA OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE<br>MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA<br>&nbsp;<br>The deep blue hill of water rolls toward shore, its weight rumbling over the shoals as it crests, its bulk split in two as it kisses the submerged concrete walls of the man-made canal. Half the wave crashes into foam and races to a quick death upon the beach, the other half rushes into the channel, picking up speed as it is redirected into the main tank of the Tanaka Lagoon.<br>The old man's almond eyes follow another wave in, his soul soothed by its crushing thunder, his mind as restless as the undulating splashes that echo throughout the deserted arena like crackling paper. From his vantage--a cold aluminum bench in the upper deck of the western bleachers--he can see everything: the incoming Pacific, the ocean-access canal, the lake-size man-made aquarium, the western horizon's dying afternoon sun.<br>Eighty-two-year-old Masao Tanaka fixes his collar against the harsh ocean breeze that howls inside his empty concrete fish bowl. Weathered eyes squint against reflections coming off the lagoon's surface. The once azure waters have stagnated olive-green, algae growth surpassing maintenance. The once-shiny A-frame, perched at the southern end of the arena like a giant steel scarecrow, is caked with layers of rust, as are the bleachers, the rest rooms, food court, and souvenir stands.<br>Masao shakes his head at the irony of his existence. The lagoon had been more than the marine biologist's dream, it had been his life, and now he is dying with it. Thirty years have passed since he first designed the facility and risked everything to build it. He had depleted his family's estate and mortgaged his children's future, and when those funds ran dry, he had accepted a high-risk contract with the Japanese Marine Science Technology Center, selling JAMSTEC twenty-five of the Institute's Unmanned Nautical Information Submersibles. The UNIS drones were to be part of Japan's Early Warning Earthquake Detection System. The catch: Masao's team would be responsible for deploying the array seven miles down in the Mariana Trench, the deepest, most unexplored realm on the planet.<br>Masao's son, D.J., had escorted each UNIS into position, piloting an Abyss Glider-II, the Institute's one-man deep-sea submersible. For weeks the detection system worked flawlessly, and then one by one, the drones stopped transmitting data. With the Japanese threatening to hold back payment, Masao had been forced to call in a favor from an old friend.<br>Jonas Taylor had been the best deep-sea submersible pilot ever to wear the Navy uniform--until something happened to him on his last dive in the Mariana Trench. Working in 33,000 feet of water, Jonas had suddenly panicked, launching his vessel into an emergency ascent. The duress of the maneuver had caused a malfunction in the sub's pressurization system and the two scientists on board had died. Diagnosed with psychosis of the deep, Jonas had been forced to spend three months in a psychiatric ward. His naval career over, his confidence shot, Jonas reinvented himself, going back to school to study paleobiology, intent on convincing the world that he was not crazy, that the unexplored sevenmile-deep gorge was inhabited by sixty-foot prehistoric sharks, long thought extinct.<br>Masao cared little about Jonas's theories; what he needed was a second deep-sea pilot to accompany his son on a salvage operation. Jonas accepted the old man's invitation, more focused on locating an unfossilized Megalodon tooth, proof that the creatures were still alive.<br>What he found instead was his own personal Hell.<br>Jonas Taylor was right, members of the Megalodon species had survived extinction in the hydrothermally-warmed bottom layer of the trench.<br>Upon entering the abyss, the two mini-subs' engines had attracted a male. D.J. was attacked and devoured, the Meg entwining itself in his sub's cable. As Masao's surface ship unwittingly hauled the entrapped beast topside, a larger female attacked the male, following it to the surface.<br>Having summoned the devil from its purgatory, it was left to Jonas and his team to stop it.<br>More death would follow as the Tanaka Institute attempted to capture the female, which birthed three pups in the deep waters off Monterey, California. Jonas was eventually forced to kill the creature, with the lone surviving pup captured and raised in Masao's whale lagoon.<br><i>Come see Angel: the Angel of Death. Two shows daily</i>.<br>The captive female would attract millions of visitors and even more dollars. But a series of devastating lawsuits would cripple the Institute, forcing Masao to sell the majority of his company to energy mogul Benedict Singer. Losing control of his beloved Institute was bad enough, the undue stress on his family even worse. Terry's first pregnancy was stillborn, and Jonas was not there for her, too preoccupied with his concerns over keeping Angel secured in the lagoon. Eventually the female did escape, nearly taking the lives of Masao's daughter and son-in-law in the process.<br>Benedict Singer's demise would return the Institute to its rightful owner. Three years after Angel's escape, the lagoon's new canal doors were reopened, this time for the advancement of cetacean science, as had always been intended.<br>Masao had a new lease on life. Each winter day, as tens of thousands of the behemoths migrated south from the Bering Sea, the biologist would wait by the open canal doors, hoping to lure a pregnant cow into his protected cove to birth her young.<br>"Spooked...</p><h2>Carolina Gold</h2><p><p><em>The war is over, but at Fairhaven Plantation, Charlotte's struggle has just begun.</em></p><p>Following her father&#x2019;s death, Charlotte Fraser returns to Fairhaven, her family&#x2019;s rice plantation in the South Carolina Lowcountry.

There is no reason to think that she will collapse on the spot. Since she is not truly an emergency patient, she is triaged to the back of the line, and other folks, those in immediate distress, get in for treatment ahead of her.

It has to be something serious.<br>&#x201c;We are wanted in the ER,&#x201d; I tell my team.<br>The cancer team today consists of a fellow, a resident, two medical students, and yours truly, in a flowing white coat, as the attending physician. I lead the way down the hall. Having grown up Catholic, I can&#x2019;t help thinking of the med students and young doctors as altar boys following a priest.<br>I am a medical oncologist, the kind of doctor who gives chemotherapy. My other interests are epidemiology and biostatistics. I am someone you might ask whether a drug works, whether you should get a cancer screening test, and whether a white man&#x2019;s cancer differs from a black man&#x2019;s cancer. You can also ask me if we are winning the &#x201c;war&#x201d; on the cluster of diseases we call cancer. As chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society&#x2014;a position I have held since 2007&#x2014;I often end up quoted in the newspapers, and I am on television a lot. In addition to my academic, journalistic, and public-policy roles, I have been taking care of cancer patients at Grady for nearly a decade, first as the founding director of the cancer center, and now as chief doctor at the ACS.<br>My retinue behind me, I keep up a fast pace, this side of a jog. Bill Bernstein, the fellow, is the most senior of the group. Bill is a Newton, Massachusetts, suburbanite, still boyish. He is having trouble adjusting to the South, to Atlanta, to its inner city. He is trying, but it&#x2019;s hard to miss that black people and poor people perplex him. Contact with so much despair makes him awkward. But he has a good heart, a surfeit of common sense&#x2014;and he is smart. Whatever we teach him at Grady will make him a better doctor wherever he ends up.<br>Grady suffers from what the administration here calls a &#x201c;vertical transportation problem.&#x201d; Our elevators are slow at best, broken at worst. We head for the stairs, rushing down to the first floor, then through long, green hallways into the ER.<br>Grady is a monument to racism. Racism is built into it, as is poverty, as is despair. Shaped like a capital letter <i>H,</i> Grady is essentially two hospitals with a hallway&#x2014;a crossover&#x2014;in the middle to keep things separate but equal for sixteen stories.<br>In the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, white patients were wheeled into the front section, which faces the city. Blacks went to the back of the <i>H.</i> This structure&#x2014;built in 1953&#x2014;was actually an improvement over the previous incarnation. The Big H&#x2014;the current Grady&#x2014;replaced two separate buildings&#x2014;the whites got a brick building, the blacks a run-down wood-frame structure. Older Atlantans continue to refer to the place in a chilling plural, the Gradys.<br>You end up at Grady for four main reasons. It could happen because you have no insurance and are denied care at a private hospital, or because you are unconscious when you arrive by ambulance. When your lights are out, you are in no position to ask to be taken to a cleaner, better-lit, suburban palace of medicine. A third, small contingent are older black folks with insurance, who could go anywhere but have retained a dim memory of Grady as the only Atlanta hospital that accepted us. The fourth category, injured cops and firemen, know that we see a lot of shock and trauma and are good at it. We are their ER of choice.<br>Today, our 950-bed behemoth stands for another form of segregation: poor versus rich, separate but with no pretense of equality. Grady is Atlanta&#x2019;s safety-net hospital. It is also the largest hospital in the United States.<br>The ER, arguably the principal entry point to Grady, was built in the center of the hospital, filling in some of the <i>H</i> on the first floor. To build it, Grady administrators got some federal funds in time for the 1996 Summer Olympics. This fueled financial machinations, which led to criminal charges, which led to prison terms. (In retrospect, the bulk of the money was put to good use. Many of the victims of the Olympic Park bombing came through our ER.)<br>The hallways here are incredibly crowded, even by the standards of inner-city hospitals. Patients are triaged into three color-coded lines&#x2014;surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics&#x2014;and placed on gurneys two-deep, leaving almost no room for staff to squeeze through.<br>You might see a homeless woman drifting in and out of consciousness next to a Georgia Tech student bloodied from being pistol-whipped in an armed robbery, next to a fifty-seven-year-old suburban secretary terrified by a sudden loss of vision, next to a twenty-eight-year-old hooker writhing in pain that shoots up from her lower abdomen, next to a conventioneer who blacked out briefly in a cylindrical tower of a downtown hotel, next to a fourteen-year-old slum dweller who struggles for breath as his asthma attack subsides.<br>When I first arrived in Atlanta and all of this was new to me, I took my wife, Yolanda, through the Grady ER on a Friday night.<br>&#x201c;Oh, the humanity,&#x201d; she said.<br>Yolanda, a lawyer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, feels happier above the Mason-Dixon Line.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>TAMMIE Quest&#x2014;I use her real name&#x2014;is cute, has a broad, infectious smile, and comes from privilege. She grew up in Southern California and frequently refers to herself as a &#x201c;black Valley girl.&#x201d;<br>Though she identifies with the West Coast, a lot of Atlanta has rubbed off on her in the Grady ER.<br>No two ERs are alike. Ours tells the story of Atlanta more clearly, more poignantly than its skyline. Patients everywhere are scared of their wounds or diseases that rage inside them. Here, in the middle of this big, hot, loud, violent city, they have an added fear: they are terrified of each other, often with good cause.<br>Elsewhere, patients might trust us doctors, admire us, even bow to our robes, our honorifics, and the all-caps abbreviations that follow our names. Here, not so much.<br>A place called Tuskegee is about two hours away from here. It&#x2019;s where government doctors staged a medical experiment in the thirties: they watched black men die of syphilis, withholding treatment even after effective drugs were invented.<br>Tuskegee is not an abstraction in these parts. It&#x2019;s a physical place, as palpable as a big, deep wound, and eighty-plus years don&#x2019;t mean a thing. Tuskegee is a huge, flashing CAUTION sign in the consciousness of Southern black folks. It explains why they don&#x2019;t trust doctors much and why good docs such as Tammie have to fight so hard to earn their elementary trust.<br>Like me, Tammie is a member of the medical-school faculty at Emory University, and, like me, she has several academic interests. One of these interests is end-of-life care for cancer patients: controlling the symptoms when someone with advanced cancer shows up in your ER.<br>Seeing us approach, she walks toward us and hands me a wooden clipboard with the Grady forms. I look at her face, gauging the mixture of sadness, moral outrage, and fatigue.<br>She says something like &#x201c;This patient <i>needs</i> someone who cares,&#x201d; and disappears.<br>I glance at the chief complaint.<br>&#x201c;Holy shit,&#x201d; I say to Bill Bernstein and, more so, to myself.<br>I introduce myself to a trim, middle-aged, black woman, not unattractive, wearing a blue examination gown conspicuously stamped GRADY. (At Grady, things such as gowns, infusion pumps, and money tend to vanish.)<br>From the moment Tammie paged me, I knew that the situation had to be more than a run-of-the-mill emergency. This patient clearly is not about to die on the examination table. She doesn&#x2019;t need emergency treatment. Before anything, she needs somebody to talk to. She needs attention, both medical and human.<br>The patient, Edna Riggs, is fifty-three. She works for the phone company and lives on the southeast side of Atlanta.<br>Sitting on an exam table, she looks placid. When she extends her hand, it feels limp. She makes fleeting eye contact. This is depression, maybe. Shame does the same thing, as does a sense of doom. <i>Fatalism</i> is the word doctors have repurposed to describe this last form of alienation.<br>In medicine, we speak a language of our own, and Edna&#x2019;s physical problem has a name in doctorese: automastectomy.

TV tie-in.</p><p>John Mortimer is a playwright, novelist, and former practicing barrister who has written many film scripts as well as stage, radio, and television plays, the Rumpole plays, for which he received the British Academy Writer of the Year Award, and the adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x2019;s <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>. He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.Actor Leo McKern, who played Rumpole on the PBS series, may have died, but the world still has a remarkable interpretation of the Old Bailey defender--in Timothy West's narration. The stories in this volume are familiar from the "Rumpole of the Bailey" TV series, but they're still a treat, not just for the courtroom drama, but also for Rumpole's deft handling of office conflicts. The story line weaves through the seven mysteries, kicking off with a member of the Timson clan falsely accused of devil worship, sending Rumpole into a hostile child welfare court, and ending with Rumpole facing charges of unethical conduct.

Plots turn on curious exigencies&#x2015;a woman about to star in her first porn film; a night doctor who adds new meaning to "specialist"; a ghost whose neglect is greatly resented. "In the space of ten or twenty pages," as the <em>Nouvel Observateur</em> remarked, "Mar�as contrives to write a novel." "The short story fits Mar�as like a glove," as <em>Le Point</em> noted, and these stories have been acclaimed as "dazzling" (<em>The London Times Literary Supplement</em>); "formidably intelligent" (<em>The London Review of Books</em>); and "startling" (<em>The New York Times Book Review</em>).</p><p><p><strong>Javier Mar�as</strong> is an award-winning Spanish novelist. He is also a translator and columnist, as well as the current king of Redonda. He was born in Madrid in 1951 and published his first novel at the age of nineteen. He has held academic posts in Spain, the US (he was a visiting professor at Wellesley College) and Britain, as a lecturer in Spanish Literature at Oxford University. He has been translated into 34 languages, and more than six million copies of his books have been sold worldwide. In 1997 he won the Nelly Sachs Award; the Comunidad de Madrid award in 1998; in 2000 the Grinzane Cavour Award, the Alberto Moravia Prize, and the Dublin IMPAC Award. He also won the Spanish National Translation Award in 1979 for his translation of <em>Tristram Shandy</em> in 1979. He was a professor at Oxford University and the Complutense of Madrid. He currently lives in Madrid.</p><p>Award-winning translator <strong>Margaret Jull Costa</strong> lives in England.&nbsp;</p>Like Borges, who felt that every story benefited from a good mystery, Mar!as (A Heart So White) packs murder, intrigue, even ghosts into nearly every one of the dozen short narratives in this collection. Mar!as, one of Spain's most prominent contemporary writers, shows his macabre playfulness right from the start. In "The Night Doctor," a dinner party leads to a nighttime walk through Paris, and introduces two similar Italian women with similarly unpleasant husbands, and a mysterious doctor whose evening visits may put a permanent end to their marital problems. In "Broken Binoculars," a seemingly innocuous conversation at the racetrack develops into a frank discussion of assassination. "Flesh Sunday" features a man looking out from the balcony of his honeymoon hotel room. While his wife lies on the bed behind him, he watches a woman who may--or may not--be waiting for him. These tales, like others in the collection, are enigmatic, almost elliptical, and are related by a narrator distinguished by his urbane wit and unflappability. The one long story here, "Blood on a Spear," typifies the author's taste for misdirection. The intriguing opening scene shows the narrator's friend murdered, impaled on his bed with a naked woman by his side. As the unnamed narrator investigates, he learns that little is as it initially seems. In a foreword, Mar!as reveals that nearly all the short fictions were written on commission, and that many came with external requirements (such as a summer setting, or a crime element), which heightened Mar!as's literary gamesmanship. The foreword also discloses, amusingly, that "Broken Binoculars" originally appeared with the first page accidentally discarded, in what Mar!as calls "the worst printer's error ever perpetrated on one of my texts." (Apr.) FYI: Mar!as won the 1997 International IMPAC Literary Award for A Heart So White. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Silence of the North,</h2><p>Records the struggles of a woman who confronted the challenges and hardships of life in the wilderness of northern Canada</p><p>When she was nine years old, Olive Fredrickson witnessed her mother's death in the Arctic wilderness. At nineteen, she married a trapper who led her into a perilous life far removed from the comforts of civilization. Told from a harrowing first-person perspective, Fredrickson recounts the hair-raising experiences of her first years in the frozen wasteland that was her husband's hunting ground. When her attempt to run a farm single-handedly, after her husband's death, threatened to end in ruin, Fredrickson walked 40 miles alone to the nearest village, in a desperate attempt to obtain food for her starving family by bartering against future crops. It was a life-or-death journey filled with bears, wolves, and unparalleled danger.The Silence of the North is a story of extraordinary adventure, courage, and human determination in the face of impossible odds.

Her many awards include the Kate Greenaway Medal and the prestigious Eleanor Farjeon Award for her services to children&#39;s literature.If childhood has an illustrator laureate, it must be Hughes: no one else captures emotions, concerns, and body language with such sensibility and affection. Here, she explores the concepts embraced by her title in a series of statements by a young child, depicting her in typical activities involving her family and neighbors. ``I gave Mom a present...And she gave me a big kiss.'' Not all return gifts are as welcome: ``...the baby gave me two of his soggy bread crusts''; the cat, coerced into a doll carriage, ``a nasty scratch.'' Touching on smiles and frowns, parties and bus seats, Hughes gently considers generosity, reciprocity, and even turning the other cheek--in this warm, wise, deceptively simple book. Endpaper vignettes introduce additional verbs; a companion title, Bouncing (ISBN 1-56402-128-9) follows the same tots through a merrily rambunctious day.

His first novel, <em>Wait Until Spring</em>, Bandini, was published in 1938 and was the first of his Arturo Bandini series of novels, which also include <em>The Road to Los Angeles</em> and <em>Ask the Dust</em>. A prolific screenwriter, he was stricken with diabetes in 1955. Complications from the disease brought about his blindness in 1978 and, within two years, the amputation of both legs. He continued to write by dictation to his wife, Joyce, and published <em>Dreams from Bunker Hill</em>, the final installment of the Arturo Bandini series, in 1982.

"The Lifeboat Mutiny" represents Sheckley's classic Triple A Ace Interplanetary Decontamination Agency at its risible best (all the other stories of that agency are here, too). "Pilgrimage to Earth" presents an edgy version of the farm-boy-(from a far colony)-in-the-big-city (a decadent Earth) scenario, and "Skulking Permit," "Gray Flannel Armor," "Fool's Mate," and a dozen others just as good places for innocent readers to start an acquaintance with Sheckley. And it must be said that, though such readers are greatly served by this volume, so too, because much of Sheckley's work has been hard to come by for a good many years, are old fans. A welcome replacement for all those tattered paperbacks on the sf shelves. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Frank Meeink has written a book about his journey called Autobiography of a Recovering Skinhead"&#x2014;KUOW: NPR Member Station <br><br> "Former neo-Nazi&#x2019;s story offers profound lesson in Trump era."&#x2014;Lisa Falkenberg, <i>Houston Chronicle</i> <br><br> "Frank Meeink, A Recovering Skinhead on Leaving Hatred Behind. Now a noted speaker, author and founder of Harmony Through Hockey, Frank&#x2019;s life stands for tolerance, diversity and mutual understanding in racial, political and all aspects of society. Frank is truly an inspiration in any time of strife and conflict."&#x2014;Newchurch Live <br><br> "Frank Meeink&#x2019;s story is so brutal, so visceral, so unflinching, and in the end, so soul-wrenchingly, specifically American, that it should from this moment on be required reading for anyone who wants to understand the origin of race hatred in these United States of America. Autobiography of a Recovering Skinhead stands out as more than a great memoir. It is testament to a great heart, to a man willing to own up to his own violent past and, ultimately, shine a light of hope on this sick, pigment-fixated, demented nation we inhabit. The writing is phenomenal and Meeink&#x2019;s tale will keep you riveted. In the end, like all true testaments, what the author has to offer is hard-earned, down-to-the-bone hope. I loved this book."&#x2014;Jerry Stahl, author of <i>Pain Killers and Permanent Midnight</i> <br><br> "I was unable to put this book down. Frank&#x2019;s story pulled me in to the point I felt I was living it with him, like I was skating alongside him as he overcame the odds and changed his life and, along the way, proved how hockey and other sports can change other kids&#x2019; lives, too."&#x2014;Bobby Ryan, Forward for the Snaheim Ducks <br><br> "The book&#x2019;s lasting impression is of the brutality of Meeink&#x2019;s earlier incarnation, and one wonders if those drawn to white supremacy and hatred could take any lessons from it before their beliefs come to harm others."&#x2014;Caleb Powell, <i>The Rumpus</i> <br><br> "Frank Meeink is the real deal! <i>Autobiography of a Recovering Skinhead</i> will captivate you and open your eyes to the struggles of racism.

It is full of strange texts and startling procedures, histories and natural histories, high lyricism and extended meditations-- extraordinary works that challenge our notions of what a poem ought to be. <p>Since Whitman and Dickinson, most of the major poetry in the United States has been written against the literary establishments and prevailing canons of taste, and often far from the cultural centers. This is the first anthology in many years to gather the work from this continuing tradition of innovators and outsiders, presenting poets and poems that are still excluded from the academic collections. </p><p>Opening with the last poems of the Modernist masters Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and H.D., the book follows through four generations of writers who have been the primary figures of the new poetries and poetics since 1950. With a historical afterword, complete bibliographies, and generous selections from each of the thirty-five poets, this anthology is the only available introduction to the poets connected with such groups and movements as the Objectivists, the Beats, Black Mountain, the New York School, the San Francisco Renaissance, and ethnopoetics.</p></p><p>Gathering 35 poets, Weinberger ( Outside Stories ) claims he chose 1950 as his starting point because it was when Charles Olson's "The Kingfishers" appeared in a magazine--a choice as idiosyncratic as everything else in this hefty but insubstantial anthology. Olson's predecessors (Williams, Pound, H.D.) don't need inclusion in one more textbook. Many of his contemporaries (Levertov, Creeley, Duncan) have been similarly absorbed into the mainstream. And however much light Olson's work might shed on those who came later (Susan Howe, Clark Coolidge, Michael Palmer), the volume never achieves the "hubbub of conversations" its editor intended. Only John Cage, Langston Hughes and Muriel Rukeyser are presented in an unexpected context of experimental poetry. Weinberger keeps his introductory comments to a minimum, but his historical synopsis at book's end is another enigma. One moment he seems to be talking to a group of high school kids with comments such as "the Hippies were the spiritual children of the Beats" while the next moment he's addressing literary aesthetes familiar with the names of obscure writers and publications. And while this epilogue gives insights into the lives of the poets included, wouldn't insights into their work have been more valuable? <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Since Whitman and Dickinson, most of the major poetry in the United States has been written against the literary establishments and prevailing canons of taste, and often far from the cultural centers.

He lives in Washington, D.C.Chapter 1<br><br><b>Learn as much as possible about how your brain works.</b><br><br>This is the most important factor in getting smart and staying smart. In order to do this, you don't have to become a neurologist or subscribe to scholarly journals on neuroscience (the study of the brain at every operating level ranging from everyday observable behavior to brain processes taking place at the level of chemicals and molecules). Here is a useful summary of the facts you should know.<br><br>The adult human brain weighs about three pounds and consists of about 100 billion nerve cells or neurons along with an even greater number of non-neuronal cells called glia (in Greek, glia means "glue") interspersed among the neurons. The neurons are responsible for the communication of information throughout the brain. Especially important is the brain's outer wrinkled mantle, the cerebral cortex, which gives the brain the appearance of a gnarled walnut. The cerebral cortex contains about 30 billion neurons linked to one another by means of a million billion neuronal connections called synapses.<br><br>As pointed out by Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist Gerald Edelman, more than 32 million years would be required to count all of the synapses in the human brain at a counting rate of one synapse per second. And if we concentrate on the number of possible neuronal connections (circuits) within the brain, we get an even more astounding number: 10 followed by a million zeros. To put that number into some kind of perspective, consider that the number of particles in the known universe comes to only 10 followed by seventy-nine zeros. Finally, consider that the glia, which exceed the number of neurons by at least a power of 10, are also believed to be capable of communication. If this is true, then the number of possible brain states exceeds even our most extravagant projections.<br><br>Any of the brain's 100 or so billion neurons can potentially communicate with any other via one or more linkages. Indeed, each neuron is no more than two or three degrees of separation from another. Linkages, once formed, are strengthened by repetition. At the behavioral level, this takes the form of habit. Each time you practice a piano piece or a golf swing (presuming you are doing it correctly), your performance improves. This corresponds at the neuronal level to the establishment and facilitation of neuronal circuits.<br><br>The cerebral cortex consists of the outer gray matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum, the two structures that contain most of the neurons in the brain. Less than a quarter inch in thickness, this thin rind (cortex in the original Latin means "rind"), includes some 85 percent of all brain tissue. An obvious feature of the cerebral cortex is its highly convoluted surface and wrinkled appearance. This wrinkling serves the purpose of increasing the surface area of this thin outer layer without a corresponding increase in volume and size (similar to wrinkling a handkerchief so that the larger surface area can be contained in the smaller confines of a wallet or small purse).<br><br>While it's true that certain brain areas are specialized (such as the centers for processing sight, sound, touch, and other qualities and properties), the largest portion of the brain, the association cortex, is devoted to establishing networks and thereby linking everything together throughout the brain. As a result of this networking, you don't separately see, hear, taste, smell, and feel your breakfast bagel-you experience it as a unity. It's the association cortex that makes that possible. Figure B, on page 23, shows the association cortex. Notice that it makes up more than 90 percent of the brain. Figure A, on page 22, depicts the other major brain areas along with some of their specialized functions. Notice that the right and left hemispheres are specialized for different functions as depicted in Figure C, on page 24, and discussed in detail later in the book.<br><br>Below the cerebral hemispheres lies a group of nuclei (collections of nerve cells) that organize movement. These nuclei, called the basal ganglia, enable you to do such things as skillfully maneuver your way through heavy traffic while simultaneously rehearsing what you're going to say at the business meeting later in the morning. In computer terms, the cerebral cortex writes the software programs for actions and, after some practice on your part, the basal ganglia take over to run the programs that enable you to carry out the actions. When you learn the tango, for instance, you have to concentrate (i.e., use the cerebral cortex) to plan, learn, and get comfortable with the steps. But after some practice and experience, you're eventually able to tango while thinking of other things because the basal ganglia are operating that system automatically.<br><br>Toward the back of the brain resides the cerebellum, a center involved in movement, balance, and coordination. The last time you watched a gymnast at the top of his or her form you were watching the cerebellum operating at its highest level. But the structure is not just for balance and coordination; it is also involved in the planning activities that precede movement.<br><br>Nevertheless, as we will illustrate throughout this book, the brain can't be considered only in terms of its separate components. Think of it as a unified structure in which each part contributes toward its total functioning. As an example, suppose you suddenly decide you'd like a pizza. That thought is formulated as an action plan by the frontal lobes, which are located just behind your forehead, and results in impulses directed to the cerebellum. Your cerebellum, along with structures from the basal ganglia (sometimes referred to as subcortical motor centers), translates the frontal lobes' action plan into a motor program. First you make a phone call and arrange for the pizza delivery; then you pay the delivery person upon arrival; finally, you sit down, open the box, and reach in for that first slice. Each of these separate motions involves different muscles activated in a different sequence. Or you might use different muscles depending on the circumstances. For instance, if your right elbow is slightly sore from too much tennis, you'll have to eat the pizza with your nondominant left hand. In order to make this switch, your cerebellum formulates a change in the motor program received from the frontal lobes. Indeed, the cerebellum springs into action prior to any perceptible movement on your part. Thus, when your hand approaches the pizza the cerebellum has already predicted and anticipated all of the necessary fine hand and finger movements that will take place over the next minute or so. Such an anticipatory function operates over your entire life span, during which your cerebellum regularly programs hundreds of thousands of action sequences involving every muscle in the body.<br><br>But your cerebellum isn't just a glorified personal trainer that integrates muscles into motor programs. The cerebellum is also integral to activities not involving movement at all, such as when you try to solve a problem, or remember someone's name, or maybe just do nothing more than sit and think. The cerebellum of music conductors, for instance, springs into action when the conductors listen to or read the score of an unfamiliar Bach chorale. Since the conductors are not moving at the time, their cerebellar activity must relate to their listening to and thinking about the music. As a practical application of this research finding that simply listening to or reading a musical score is sufficient for cerebellar activation, consider boosting your own brain circuitry by refining your musical appreciation and knowledge. As Gordon Shaw, a physicist at the University of California at Irvine, puts it, "music is tapping into an inherent structure of the brain." We'll say more about that "tapping" in chapter 23.<br><br>But the findings of cerebellar enhancement are not limited to music. Neuroscientists have known for years that any skilled activity enhances the cerebellum. In addition, we now know that imaging or mentally concentrating on the activities can accomplish a similar result. Of course, that doesn't mean you can become a musician or an athlete by thought alone. You have to undertake the discipline of learning how to play the violin or perfecting your tennis backhand. But once you've made progress in your training, imaging can help activate and sustain the necessary circuits. Extensive two-way connections between cerebellum and frontal cortex make this possible.<br><br>Indeed, thought and movement are integrated via the two-directional interplay between the cerebrum-the enlarged wrinkled structure at the top of the brain-and the cerebellum. Mental agility and physical agility complement rather than act in opposition to each other. Therefore, relegate to the Museum of Outmoded Ideas your stereotypes of "dumb" athletes and physically inactive superpower intellects. In most instances, your typical professional athlete spends many hours mentally rehearsing the moves or plays that bring victory. And most writers and other intellectuals try to put aside some time each day for exercise: they've learned that even a short exercise break clears the head and gets the intellectual juices flowing again.<br><br>And what about the emotional response to such experiences? That's when the limbic system kicks into gear. The limbic system is a shorthand term for the brain structures within and below the cerebrum. Its most important components are the cingulate gyrus in the cerebrum and the hippocampus and amygdala buried below the cerebral hemispheres.<br><br>On the microscopic level, neurons interconnect with one another for the purpose of processing electrical and chemical information. One of the great mysteries of the human brain concerns how these electrical and chemical codes are converted into your desire for that pizza. So far, no one has the solution to the mystery-which is usually referred to as the mind-brain problem. Perhaps nobody will ever solve it, sinc...</p><h2>Psalms</h2><p>These psalms grow out of a decades-long fascination with the biblical psalms, particularly the Davidic psalms, which portray the tempestuous, sometimes awful intimacy of the Divine-human relationship. In the lightning-shot Psalm-space where Divine meets human, time shatters, splits, leaps like a river, and so does the soul of the speaker, now hunting God, now hunted, now languishing in despair, now reclining in quiet triumph against the pillars of Heavens. These contemporary psalms attempt to create a corollary to that biblical psalm space, a space narrowed to a single room in which God and the speaker have no choice but to face and struggle toward one another through the whirlwind of pain and love.</p><p></p><h2>30-minute therapy for ANXIETY</h2><p>If your anxiety is getting in the way of living a normal life, you need help now, rather than later.

Is experience a valid test of truth?<br>Now, in Charismatic Chaos, John MacArthur takes a penetrating look at today's charismatic movement. With seasoned wisdom, he targets critical differences between charismatic and non-charismatic Christians. But he doesn't stop there. "My principal concern" writes MacArthur, "is to call the church to a firm commitment to the purity and authority of the Scriptures, and thereby strengthen the unity of the true church."<br>To tough questions that seem to divide, Charismatic Chaos provides tougher answers that strive to unite.</p><p>The charismatic movement of the past quarter-century has made an impact on the church unparalleled in history. But one legacy of the movement is confusion and mushy thinking. In Charismatic Chaos, John F. MacArthur calls for biblical evaluation and analyzes the doctrinal differences between charismatics and non-charismatics in the light of Scripture. &#34;My principal concern,&#34; writes John MacArthur, &#34;is to call the church to a firm commitment to the purity and authority of the Scriptures, and thereby to strengthen the unity of the true church.&#34; To tough questions that seem to divide, Charismatic Chaos provides tougher answers that strive to unite. This book tackles such questions as - Is experience a valid test of truth? - Does God still give revelation? - Prophets, fanatics, or heretics? - Does God still heal? - What should we think of the Signs and Wonders movement? - Does the Bible promise health and wealth?<p>John MacArthur has served as the pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, since 1969. His ministry of expository preaching is unparalleled in its breadth and influence.

The famous Gibbsville stories, more than fifty of them&#x2014;include such stunners as &#x201c;The Doctor&#x2019;s Son,&#x201d; &#x201c;Imagine Kissing Pete,&#x201d; &#x201c;Fatimas and Kisses,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Cellar Domain,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Bucket of Blood.&#x201d; Again, O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s Pennsylvania Protectorate, as he called it&#x2014;in reality, the coal region of his hometown, Pottsville, in Schuylkill County&#x2014;comes to socially and sexually complicated life. Here are the miners in the company towns, the country club set, the shopkeepers, the bartenders, the barbers, and the collegians. It is a world as varied, vibrant, and complete as Faulkner&#x2019;s Yoknapatawphna County or Thomas Wolfe&#x2019;s Altamount. Presented in this Book-of-the-Month Club Selection are four decades of the best work by the author who Bennett Cerf declared one of America&#x2019;s most underrated writers.</p><p>Like Thomas Hardy, who created his fictional Wessex out of his native Dorset, and William Faulkner, who used Lafayette County, Mississippi, as the basis for his imaginary Yoknapatawpha County, O'Hara transformed his hometown of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and its surrounding anthracite coal region into one of literature's great fictional landscapes. Setting five novels and more than 50 stories in what he called his "Pennsylvania Protectorate," O'Hara recorded with great honesty the lives of Gibbsville's inhabitants--from Polish coal miners and Irish Catholic shopkeepers to the Protestant country club set. Editor Bruccoli, who championed O'Hara as one of America's great short writers in his biography The O'Hara Concern ( LJ 9/15/75), has gathered into one volume 55 Gibbsville stories written over a 30-year span. Included are some of O'Hara's most famous tales, including "The Doctor's Son," "Imagine Kissing Pete," and "The Bucket of Blood." Since many of these stories are drawn from previous collections, libraries already owning such anthologies as The Collected Stories of John O'Hara ( LJ 4/15/85) might want to consider this an optional purchase. Otherwise, this is an excellent introduction to a writer who has been unjustly ignored.<br><i>- Wilda Williams, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.&#34;Superb...the most important collection of American fiction to be published in years.&#34;</p><h2>The Researcher&#39;s Guide to American Genealogy. 3rd Edition. Paperback Version</h2><p>In every field of study there is one book that rises above the rest in stature and authority and becomes the standard work in the field. In genealogy that book is Val Greenwood&#39;s Researcher&#39;s Guide to American Genealogy. Arguably the best book ever written on American genealogy, it is the text of choice in colleges and universities or wherever courses in American genealogy are taught. Of the dozens of textbooks, manuals, and how-to books that have appeared over the past twenty-five years, it is the one book that is consistently praised for setting a standard of excellence. The Researcher&#39;s Guide has become a classic. While it instructs the researcher in the timeless principles of genealogical research, it also identifies the various classes of records employed in that research, groups them in convenient tables and charts, gives their location, explains their uses, and evaluates each of them in the context of the research process. Designed to answer practically all the researcher&#39;s needs, it is both a textbook and an all-purpose reference book. And it is this singular combination that makes The Researcher&#39;s Guide the book of choice in any genealogical investigation.</p><p></p><h2>GenX Reader</h2><p>Cursed by older generations, Generations X means a lot of things to a lot of people. They are a culture, a demographic, an outlook, a style, an economy, a scene, a literature, a political ideology, an aesthetic, an age, a decade, and a way of life.<br>Here is a collage of the most revered voices of Generation X, demonstrating that while twentysomethings may, indeed, have dropped out of American culture (as it is traditionally defined), they also stand as a testament to American ingenuity, optimism, instinct, and intelligence.</p><p></p><h2>Archaeology of Knowledge</h2><p>In France, a country that awards its intellectuals the status other countries give their rock stars, Michel Foucault was part of a glittering generation of thinkers, one which also included Sartre, de Beauvoir and Deleuze. One of the great intellectual heroes of the twentieth century, Foucault was a man whose passion and reason were at the service of nearly every progressive cause of his time. From law and order, to mental health, to power and knowledge, he spearheaded public awareness of the dynamics that hold us all in thrall to a few powerful ideologies and interests. Arguably his finest work, <em>Archaeology of Knowledge</em> is a challenging but fantastically rewarding introduction to his ideas.</p><p>Madness, sexuality, power, knowledge-are these facts of life or simply parts of speech? In a series of works of astonishing brilliance, historian Michel Foucault excavated the hidden assumptions that govern the way we live and the way we think. The Archaeology of Knowledge begins at the level of &#39;things said&#39; and moves quickly to illuminate the connections between knowledge, language, and action in a style at once profound and personal.<strong>Michel Foucault (1926-84).</strong> Celebrated French thinker and activist who challenged people's assumptions about care of the mentally ill, gay rights, prisons, the police and welfare.</p><h2>Great Lonely Places of the Texas Plains</h2><p>Clarity, focus, and startling detail are the stuff of lasting images&#x2014;in poetry or photography. It is all about beholding, about taking in what is ours to absorb&#x2014;if only we will. Little can overwhelm the senses more than our great lonely plains, expanses of sky and horizon so enormous that sometimes composition gets lost in between. Who better, then, to illuminate what would elude us than a native state photographer and native state poet laureate?Although Meinzer and McDonald have both devoted careers to seeing and celebrating these plains, garnering significant honors and awards along the way, neither had realized how much his work spoke to the other&#x2019;s. Now seventy-seven pairs of poems and color photographs testify to the kinship of poet, photographer, and all of us who inhabit their territory. Selected from hundreds of photographs and poems, these pairs show surprising harmony of vision and insights about the vast, wide plains, their dramatic colors, and the calm, vigorous people who thrive beneath their sprawling skies, accepting the risks and splendor of it all.</p><p>Walt McDonald and Wyman Meinzer combine poetry and photography into one voice--a voice that speaks from having lived and loved the hardscrabble land they share. Meinzer&#39;s photography goes beyond illustration, reflecting McDonald&#39;s poetry, giving a deeper insight.

Based on interviews with countless sources who have never spoken about Patrick before -- from the Texas beauty who shared his first kiss, to the woman he almost married, to the manager who worked closely with him from his teen idol days until his romantic tour de force in <i>Ghost</i> -- and many more, Leigh unveils surprising details about the charismatic actor's life on- and off-screen. Beginning with his training as a dancer with his choreographer mother and spanning his remarkable -- and at times challenging -- career, this groundbreaking biography of the un-forgettable entertainer is the mesmerizing, enduring, and definitive story of a man who captured our hearts.</p></p><p><b>Wendy Leigh</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of eleven books, including <i>True Grace: The Life and Times of An American Princess</i>.<p><b>One</b></p><p><b>Deep in the Heart of Texas</b></p><p>Patrick Swayze was born in Texas, the second largest U.S. state -- a state which, like him, is dramatically larger than life. But while he has always been universally regarded as the quintessential Texan, a close examination of his paternal roots tells quite another story.</p><p>While a large number of Texans boast Spanish, Mexican, or Indian ancestry, Patrick, in contrast, can trace his lineage back to England, where in 1619 his ancestor, John Swasey (sometimes known as "Sweezy"), was born in Bridgeport, Dorset. Christened at the church of St. Mary's, Bridgeport, in 1633, John Swasey sailed to Massachusetts on <i>The Recovery</i>. There he became a planter and, in 1640, purchased four acres of land in Salem, Essex County.</p><p>In May 1650, John Swasey married Katherine Kinge of Essex, England. Some genealogists claim that Swasey was one of the earliest Quakers, citing this as the reason for his refusing to take the oath of fidelity to the colony of New Haven. Whatever the grounds for his refusal, not taking the oath made him persona non grata in Salem. Consequently, in 1658 he and his wife moved to Southold, Suffolk County, Long Island, New York. In 1706, at the age of eighty-six, he died in Acquefague, Suffolk County, leaving seven children behind.</p><p>One of those children, Joseph Swasey (born 1653), married Mary Betts and had six children with her. Samuel Swayze -- later a judge -- was born to Joseph and Mary in 1689 and was one of the first family members on record to use the modern-day spelling of the Swayze name.</p><p>In 1736, Samuel Swayze, his wife Penelope Horton, and their children moved from Long Island to Black River, Chester Township, Morris County, New Jersey, where they bought a parcel of land.</p><p>Samuel was a fervent Congregationalist, and in 1747 he and his fellow Congregationalists built their own meetinghouse with pews and galleries seating four hundred and worshipped there together. In 1753, Samuel Swayze Jr. (born in 1712) became the first pastor of the church, where he served as minister for the next twenty years.</p><p>In 1772, Samuel Swayze Jr. led a group of seventy-two families on a migration from Black River to the outskirts of Natchez, Adams County, Mississippi, where he formed a Congregationalist church. Soon he and his flock became known as the Jersey Settlers, who are today considered an integral and highly respected part of the history of the South.</p><p>Strangely enough, when Patrick made his big career breakthrough starring as Orry Main in <i>North and South</i>, part of the miniseries was filmed in Natchez. When Patrick received great acclaim for his acting in the miniseries, he gave masses of press interviews yet never mentioned that he is a direct descendant of the Reverend Samuel Swayze Jr., the most famous of all the Jersey Settlers, or brought up the coincidence of <i>North and South</i> being filmed in Natchez, the home of his ancestral forebears.</p><p>Nor did he ever broach the subject of his other celebrated relatives: <i>Stalag 17</i> star William Holden, his seventh and eighth cousin (because Reverend Samuel Swayze and his brother Richard married their own cousins, who were themselves sisters), and <i>Amadeus</i> actor Tom Hulce, another, more distant cousin.</p><p>Patrick's Texas roots on his father's side begin only with his great-grandfather, James Wesley Swayze, who originally lived in Franklin Parish, Louisiana, before moving to Texas. From then on, the Swayzes were true Texans, born and bred. Texas is the birthplace of Patrick's paternal grandfather, Jesse Elijah Swayze, and his maternal grandparents, Victor and Gladys Karnes -- and his parents Jesse Wayne and Patsy Swayze, both regarded themselves as Texan to the core.</p><p>In many ways, Patrick was the embodiment of Southern pride. No matter how famous he would become, he never jettisoned his Southern values or his Southern manners. As a matter of fact, when he was on the threshold of becoming a star and his agent chided him for calling men "sir," he rounded on him indignantly and declared, "That's insanity," and in no uncertain terms informed him that he was brought up the Southern way and was proud of it. "You hold the door for women, you pull their chair. It's your job, it's not a macho thing."</p><p>Then, switching tacks, with a characteristic twinkle he added a caveat: "If you say 'sir' in a different context, it can be also very dangerous. 'Sir, you mess with me one more time and I break every bone in your body.' "</p><p>"There's a real power to Texans. Texas gives you a belief in yourself," he said with considerable pride on a 1986 visit back home. "There's a lot of emotion involved in being in Houston. This is my hometown! These are my roots!"</p><p>The TV series <i>Dallas</i> has ensured that as far as most of the world is concerned, Houston has been relegated to the second-best-known city in Texas. However, Houston is a far more international, multicultural city than Dallas. Apart from being the location of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, one of Houston's other major claims to fame is that it boasts the second largest concentration of theater seats in any downtown area in the United States.</p><p>Horses, too, are the business of Houston, and Patrick's paternal grandfather, Bud, was the foreman of the King Ranch -- the largest horse- and cattle-breedingranch in the Lone Star State, sprawling across six counties. When Patrick was a boy, his grandfather tied Patrick's wrists to a ram's horns and his feet to the ram's belly and let him go. "By the time I got off, I was close to unconscious," he recalled. "But I've always said since then, 'If it's got hair on it, I can ride it.' " His father too was a horseman, a Texas state champion cowboy, so it was hardly surprising that Patrick grew up to cherish horses in all their glory.</p><p>A love of horses was in his blood, and so too was dancing. His mother, Patsy, (born Patricia Yvonne Helen Karnes on February 7, 1927), was not only a gifted dancer herself but would also become one of the most influential dance teachers and choreographers of her generation.</p><p>His father, Jesse Wayne Swayze -- nicknamed "Big Buddy" -- was a tall, muscular, handsome man with jet black hair and blue eyes who bore some resemblance to Cary Grant yet retained the veneer of a tough macho Texan.</p><p>When Patsy and Big Buddy met in 1944, Patsy was seventeen and spirited, Big Buddy was eighteen and dashing. From the first, the passion that flared between them was inevitable. She was on the threshold of graduating from the Incarnate Word Academy of Houston, the oldest Catholic school in that city (a school which she would later credit as having taught her "that there is no such thing as failure"), and Big Buddy had enlisted in the navy. After learning that he was about to be shipped overseas, Patsy and Big Buddy were married in Missouri City, Texas, on August 6, 1944, just two weeks before Patsy's graduation day.</p><p>Their first child, Vicky, was born in 1949, followed by Patrick three years later. Like one out of every nine native Houstonians, including Kenny Rogers and Barbara Mandrell, he was born at the art deco-style St. Joseph Hospital, which was founded by the Catholic Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word in 1887. His brother Don was born in 1958 and Sean in 1962.</p><p>The Swayzes' first home in Garden Oak was adjacent to their next home in the romantic-sounding Candlelight Wood area of Oak Forest, a large residential community in northwest Houston that was established in 1947, with most of the houses sold to World War II veterans for between $8,000 and $10,000. The Swayzes were to live there through most of Patrick's childhood, right into his late twenties. Almost rural in character, yet less than ten miles from the heart of Houston, Oak Forest, situated literally in the midst of a forest, was safe, suburban, even beautiful, and the Swayzes' two-storey Greek revival-style antebellum house on Del Norte was the ideal setting in which to raise a family.</p><p>However, even in the early pre-feminist fifties, powerhouse Patsy wasn't about to become a desperate housewife on a Houstonian Wisteria Lane.</p><p>Fate in the form of a car had run her down when she was a child and caused her to take up dancing as a form of physical therapy. Soon -- through her formidable will, one which she would share with her eldest son, Patrick -- she became a dedicated dancer prepared to suffer the grueling hours of practice and hard work in quest of the joy of devoting herself to her art, her raison d'�tre and her lifelong passion.</p><p>Initially she studied with Marcella Donovan Perry, the formidable ballerina and Broadway dancer who infused both style and discipline into her dancing. By the time Patrick was born, Patsy was already well established as Houston's premiere dance teacher and choreographer. A liberated woman far ahead of her time, she founded and directed the acclaimed Houston Jazz Ballet Company, helped to develop Houston's High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, choreographed countless musicals, and ran her own dance company and dance studio, where she taught ballet, tap, and jazz to generations of students, including Patrick.</p><p>"I kind of came out of the womb onstage. I can't recall a time in my life when I wasn't dancing," he has said. And while he wasn't exactly born in a trunk in the Princess Theater, Pocatello, Idaho, like Judy Garland's Esther Blodgett in <i>A Star Is Born</i>, as a babe in arms he was carried onstage during an operetta, already in show business before he could even walk or talk.</p><p>When he was only eight months old, his mother took him with her to her dance studio, where he'd hoist himself up in his playpen and dance in time to the music, along with her pupils. And, whenever possible, she took him with her to the theater where she was choreographing a show, and he'd either watch mesmerized or sleep contentedly on the theater seats.</p><p>At three he had his first ballet lesson with his mother. The group photograph of him in shorts and shirt show him already gleeful and happy, standing with perfect posture among the other tots in the class.</p><p>Even at that early ...</p></p><h2>Muslim Mafia: Inside the Secret Underworld that&#39;s Conspiring to Islamize America</h2><p>You&#39;ve heard about the courageous young investigators who covertly videotaped officials of ACORN advocating illegal activities.

After the Muslims recapture Jerusalem, three great kings of Europe vow to regain the Holy City: King Richard the Lionhearted of England, King Philip of France, and the Emperor Frederick of Germany. Despite winning many battles in this third crusade and capturing the city of Acre, they fail to win back the city of Jerusalem. King Louis of France launches the last crusade, but dies before achieving his objective. Throughout the narrative we meet all sorts of men. Some, like Bohemond and Baldwin, fight for selfish ends; others, such as Tancred and Louis, do battle like the great knights they are; while a few, Francis among them, carry goodwill wherever they go.</p><p></p><h2>Garvey</h2><p>The popular California baseball star tells about his life, his baseball teams, his views on players and drugs, his highly publicized marriage and divorce, and his aspirations for political office</p><p>Garvey's progress from worshipful Dodger bat boy to all-star Dodger first baseman was the fulfillment of a boyhood fantasyone that Garvey confesses he has never outgrown. He sees himself as "Gary Cooper playing Lou Gehrig," and fits the role: clean-cut, pious, ever ready to sign an autograph or smile for the camera. In a book that is part memoir, part apologia, Garvey convincingly tells of his lifelong dedication to his mythical sports ideal, and of the personal price he has paid. At the peak of a splendid career came a period of crisis in which fellow players sneeringly nicknamed him "Mr. Clean," and the press attacked him for his self-promotion. The strain of this, Garvey says, contributed to his divorce. The book treats his marriage at length, but Garvey conveys little impression of his wife Cyndy as a person, or of his feelings for her. And Garvey feels that many of his teammates misunderstood him; he cannot conceive of the possibility that they may have merely disliked him. From a lonely childhood to the struggles of baseball middle-age, he views his personal life and career with an equally simplistic conventionality: all successes, no matter how fortuitous, are triumphs; all failures are character-building lessons. Garvey will disappoint gossip fans and baseball fans alike.

What did he say? What did he do? This book is all about Jesus. It puts together the story of Jesus&#39; life and message told by the people who knew him best--his disciples and friends--as recorded in the four Gospels of the Bible. Although the words were written over 2000 years ago, his message of peace, hope, love, and forgiveness still resonates with people of all races, nationalities, educational, and economic backgrounds. Some like what he said, while others disagree, but almost everyone finds him compelling. The story of Jesus comes to us from four different authors, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, written over a period of nearly seventy years. The message and uniqueness of Jesus remain the same, but each author tells the story from his perspective and for his purpose. Some writers wrote more; others wrote less. But what if we could read it as one single story from beginning to end? This book does just that by combining the four reports of Jesus&#39; life into a single chronological story, using the easy-to-read text of the NIRV Bible. Take a new look at Jesus-- his life, his miracles, and his teachings--and to come to your own conclusions about the carpenter from Nazareth.

Coover finds inspiration in everything from painting, cinema, theater, and dance to slapstick, magic acts, puzzles, and riddles.</p><p>His 1969 story "The Babysitter" has alone inspired generations of innovative young writers. Here, in this selection of his best stories, spanning more than half a century, you will find an invisible man tragically obsessed by an invisible woman; a cartoon man in a cartoon car who runs over a real man who is arrested by a real policeman with cartoon eyes; a stick man who reinvents the universe.</p><p>While invading the dreams and nightmares of others, long dead, disrupting them from within, Coover cuts to the core of how realism works. He uses metafiction as a means of &#x201c;interrogating the fiction making process,&#x201d; at least insofar as that process, when unexamined, has a way of entrapping us in false and destructive stories, myths, and belief systems. These stories are riven with paradox, ambivalence, strangeness, unrealized ambitions and desires, uncertainty, complexity, always seeking the potential for insight, for comedy.</p><p>Through their celebration of the improbable and unexpected, and their distinctive but complementary grammars of text and film, Coover&#x2019;s selected short fictions entertain by engaging with the tribal myths that surround us&#x2015;religious, patriotic, literary, erotic, popular&#x2015;often satirizing the mindsets that, out of some obscure primitive need, perpetuate them.

In it, Oriah challenges readers to discard what they know of themselves as seen through other people and the world around them, and to delve deep into their own selves to find who they truly are. She persuades the reader that there is nothing as essential as what you believe yourself to be, and that it's not necessary to search for meaning in other people and the world's agendas; just be confident of your own distinct gifts, challenges and dreams.</p></p><p><p>Oriah is the author of the inspirational prose poem and international bestselling book <em>The Invitation</em> as well as the bestsellers <em>The Dance</em> and <em>The Call</em>.

Her latest book, <em>What We Ache For: Creativity and the Unfolding of Your Soul</em>, explores creativity as a way of accessing and cultivating a spiritually rich life. Oriah is the mother of two grown sons. She lives with her husband, Jeff, several hours north of Toronto in a home surrounded by forest stillness.</p>The author, a workshop and retreat leader, follows up her two earlier bestsellers (The Invitation and The Dance) with the spiritual search that is at the center of all our lives. On a 40-day vision quest that ended abruptly when she became ill, Mountain Dreamer heeded an inner voice that instructed her to go home; once there, she continued her contemplative retreat, and through meditative practices (which she shares here), she comes to acknowledge the difficulty she has with overcoming ego demands, such as her strong drive to achieve. Although Mountain Dreamer is sincere in her wish to be of help to others, her writing lacks clarity and a strong structure. She recounts how she came to a decision to turn down an opportunity to study shamanism in the Amazon. When she prayed for guidance, she understood that, although she might make the trip someday, what she needed to learn then was to live in the moment. And that moment was one of flux, when she moved to a new home with her husband and did not see her grown sons as frequently. She digresses here on the fact that change is ongoing in every life, and on her discovery that the word at the center of her particular existence is "rest." The author's message is delivered by way of her deep spiritual convictions and New Age orientation.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Born of Defiance: The League: Nemesis Rising</h2><p><p>Born an Outcast, Talyn Batur has spent the whole of his life fighting against the prejudice of his people.

Film historian Randy Skretvedt uses original shooting scripts and unfilmed comedy routines, production logs, contracts, payroll ledgers, legal depositions, family scrapbooks and original studio publicity material -- plus exclusive interviews with dozens of the team's friends and co-workers -- to recreate, as never before, the unique environment in which the films were made. <p>Film by film, "Laurel and Hardy" truly evokes the magic behind the movies -- gag sessions, practical jokes, special effects, technical problems, musical scores, sneak previews, retakes, publicity campaigns and foreign language versions.

And with it, an evil as old as the human race . . .A second story featuring impulsive, thirtysomething Sister Joan, a nun in the Order of the Daughters of Compassion, who lives in the Order's convent in the Cornwall countryside and teaches a small class of children from local farms and the nearby gypsy community, along with newcomer Samantha Olive, whose writer father has bought an old house in the area. Sister Joan is troubled by a string of small incidents centered on the convent chapel, where a crucifix has been moved, holy water has dried up, flowers and candles have disappeared. She's disturbed also by the strange lack of mischief among her young pupils. It all culminates in the discovery, in the chapel, of the poisoned body of Petroc Lee, a gypsy boy missing for several days. Keeping much pertinent information from Detective Sergeant Mill, Sister Joan embarks on her own investigation, eventually uncovering the particularly nasty (and unlikely) source of evil. Endless replays of the convent's daily routines and the less- than-credible plot weaken a sporadically interesting story, which lacks the cohesion of the series debut, Vow of Silence. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But neither boy can predict what will happen to Hassan that afternoon - as the kites soar over the city - and how it will change their lives forever.</p></p><p>In his debut novel, <i>The Kite Runner</i>, Khaled Hosseini accomplishes what very few contemporary novelists are able to do. He manages to provide an educational and eye-opening account of a country's political turmoil--in this case, Afghanistan--while also developing characters whose heartbreaking struggles and emotional triumphs resonate with readers long after the last page has been turned over. And he does this on his first try.<p> <i>The Kite Runner</i> follows the story of Amir, the privileged son of a wealthy businessman in Kabul, and Hassan, the son of Amir's father's servant. As children in the relatively stable Afghanistan of the early 1970s, the boys are inseparable. They spend idyllic days running kites and telling stories of mystical places and powerful warriors until an unspeakable event changes the nature of their relationship forever, and eventually cements their bond in ways neither boy could have ever predicted. Even after Amir and his father flee to America, Amir remains haunted by his cowardly actions and disloyalty. In part, it is these demons and the sometimes impossible quest for forgiveness that bring him back to his war-torn native land after it comes under Taliban rule. ("...I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded, not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night.")</p><p> Some of the plot's turns and twists may be somewhat implausible, but Hosseini has created characters that seem so real that one almost forgets that <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a novel and not a memoir. At a time when Afghanistan has been thrust into the forefront of America's collective consciousness ("people sipping lattes at Starbucks were talking about the battle for Kunduz"), Hosseini offers an honest, sometimes tragic, sometimes funny, but always heartfelt view of a fascinating land. Perhaps the only true flaw in this extraordinary novel is that it ends all too soon. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p><i>?I sat on a bench near a willow tree and watched a pair of kites soaring in the sky.

Revelations about such abuse since then have confirmed that this tragedy is not limited to the U.S. Catholic Church, nor is it a new phenomenon that grew out of so-called secularizing trends of the late twentieth century. The Doyle-Sipe-Wall report clearly demonstrates a deep-seated problem that spans the Church&#39;s history. This collection of documents from official and unofficial sources begins its survey in 60 CE and concludes with the contemporary scandal. It reveals an institution that has tried to come to grips with this devastating internal problem from its earliest years. At times circumspect and at other times open and direct, Church leaders tried a variety of means to rein in the various violations of clerical celibacy. The sexual abuse crisis is not isolated from the questions of the celibate practice of all Catholic clergy and the moral questions that involve marriage and all human sexual behaviors. These are the main, yet unspoken, reasons why sexual abuse has been such an inflammatory and dangerous issue for the hierarchy. The Church abuse scandal of the contemporary era, rather than seen as a new challenge, is actually the catalyst for a complex process that is forcing the official Church to redefine its ideology of sexuality, its responsibility to its members and its role in society. The three distinguished authors have served as experts and consultants in over 1,000 cases of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy, and have collectively spent over 70 years of official service within the church.</p><p>2007 Independent Publisher Book Awards, Gold Medal, ReligionThe three distinguished authors have served as experts and consultants in over 1,000 cases of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy, and have collectively spent over 70 years of official service within the church. <p>Thomas P.

He is well known for his 93-page report to U.S. bishops in 1985 warning of an impending crisis involving pedophile priests. When The Voice of the Faithful honored Doyle with their first Priest of Integrity Award, David Clohessy, national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), called him an absolute hero."

As an independent film producer, George Pelecanos has handled the movies of the Coen Brothers and other cutting edge movie mavericks.Welcome to the unlit bleakness of grunge crime fiction. Nick Stefanos (Nick's Trip) inhabits D.C.'s most squalid streets, tending bar, boozing for free, wasting his 30s and dating a girl with a taste for the sauce to rival his. One night, out on a bender and nearly passed out, he hears a murder being committed and decides to find the killers (how a guy this hammered can later remember so much is cheerfully glossed over). Nick gets himself an alarmingly straight-arrow partner and dives headlong into the underbelly of the porn trade. Two young black men have been dealing drugs and selling their bodies; one is dead, and the other is missing. Stefanos only pauses to drink, listen to music by bands with whom only the hippest readers will be familiar and have a few bouts of desperate sex. Although his innumerable descriptions of bars and boozing might leave some bored (or queasy), Pelecanos joins company with James Ellroy, Andrew Vachss and Jack O' Connell in extending the noirest tones of crime fiction. Here, he unleashes a lacerating view of urban angst and degradation. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Church Mice in Action</h2><p>The church mice of the Wortlethorp Church Vestry decide to enter Sampson, the cat, in cat shows in order to win prize money to fix the leaky church roof</p><p>Graham Oakley started illustrating books in the late 1950s, and became a full time author and illustrator after leaving his position as a set designer at the BBC.

By its end, the phrase most widely quoted was 'the clash of civilizations'. The tragedy of 11 September intensified the danger posed by religious differences throughout the world. As the politics of identity replaces the politics of ideology, can religion overcome its conflict-ridden past and become a force for peace?<br>The Dignity of Difference is Rabbi Jonathan Sacks' radical proposal for reframing the terms of this important debate. The first major statement by a Jewish leader on the ethics of globalization, it introduces a new paradigm into the search for co-existence. Sacks argues that we must do more than search for common human values. We must also learn to make space for difference, even and especially at the heart of the monotheistic imagination. The global future will call for something stronger than earlier doctrines of toleration or pluralism. It needs a new understanding that the unity of the Creator is expressed in the diversity of creation.</p><p><p>Sir Jonathan Sacks is Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of Britain and the Commonwealth.

Their misfortunes begin one gray day on Briny Beach when Mr. Poe tells them that their parents perished in a fire that destroyed their whole house. "It is useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet, Klaus, and even Sunny felt in the time that followed," laments the personable (occasionally pedantic) narrator, who tells the story as if his readers are gathered around an armchair on pillows. But of course what follows is dreadful. The children thought it was bad when the well-meaning Poes bought them grotesque-colored clothing that itched. But when they are ushered to the dilapidated doorstep of the miserable, thin, unshaven, shiny-eyed, money-grubbing Count Olaf, they know that they--and their family fortune--are in real trouble. Still, they could never have anticipated how much trouble. While it's true that the events that unfold in Lemony Snicket's novels are bleak, and things never turn out as you'd hope, these delightful, funny, linguistically playful books are reminiscent of Roald Dahl (remember <i>James and the Giant Peach</i> and his horrid spinster aunts), Charles Dickens (the orphaned Pip in <i>Great Expectations</i> without the mysterious benefactor), and Edward Gorey (<i>The Gashlycrumb Tinies</i>). There is no question that young readers will want to read the continuing unlucky adventures of the Baudelaire children in <i>The Reptile Room</i> and <i>The Wide Window</i>. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i><p>Dear Reader, </p><p>The book you are holding in your hands is a short-lived edition of a book that will likely make your life shorter as well.

Based on Robinson's papers and on interviews with his wives and friends, this dutiful biography tries to explain the character and personality of the popular but enigmatic tap dancer but is more successful at chronicling his career. Here are glimpses of his struggles to overcome the color barrier on his way to stardom in white vaudeville, musicals (especially The Hot Mikado), films and radio, his addiction to gambling and compulsive need to live on borrowed money, his generosity (he performed at more than 3000 benefits) and his love for his native city. Haskins is the author of Queen of the Blues; Mitgang is a black-theater historian. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.To most people, Bill Robinson was Shirley Temple's tap-dancing partner in films of the 1930s. Yet he also was one of the country's foremost and best-loved vaudeville headliners. The authors tell of Robinson's life from his early days as an orphan in Richmond, dancing on street corners, through his illustrious career. They deal squarely with Robinson's gambling and three marriages, and succeed splendidly in detailing the hardships faced by a black performer in a white entertainment world, but at times the writing is choppy and too adulatory.

In book after book, writing long (<i>Under the Dome</i>, <i>11/22/63</i>) or short (<i>Joyland</i>) he manages, nearly always, to tell a compelling story that is both entertaining and somehow profound, or at least thoughtful. His latest, <i>Revival</i>, is vintage King. It&#x2019;s the perfect mix of baby boomer nostalgia (think <i>Stand By Me</i>) &#x2013; this guy remembers the 60s with details you usually can only find in photographs &#x2013; and good old American horror, the kind that was first elevated by such minor writers as, say, Poe and Hawthorne. The story here centers on a reverend who comes to a New England town, befriends and mentors a young boy, and then goes wild with grief when his family dies in an accident; he gives a blasphemous sermon and is, basically, run out of town. Cut to: a couple decades later, when the boy, now a junkie, meets up by chance with the disgraced clergyman, and they form another disturbing relationship. Reverend Jacobs, it turns out, was always more complicated than the stereotypical man of God &#x2013; he is fascinated by electricity, by science &#x2013; and pretty demonic, too. How he and Jamie find and fight each other over their lifetimes is as shocking and inevitable as the explosive and, yes, horrorish, climax of the book. Never mind that King&#x2019;s prose can sometimes lapse into laughable clich� &#x2013; &#x201c;like water through a sieve&#x201d;? Really? &#x2013; there is absolutely no better storyteller than Stephen King, who keeps us up at night, with fear and fascination and admiration. <i>&#x2013;Sara Nelson</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers. His recent work includes Doctor Sleep and Under the Dome, now a major TV miniseries on CBS. His novel 11/22/63 was named a top ten book of 2011 by The New York Times Book Review and won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Mystery/Thriller as well as the Best Hardcover Book Award from the International Thriller Writers Association.

Having studied the Bible as history, it seemed natural to her that there should be a "seer" or "holy man" or "prophet" alive in our time. So, in 1953, after graduating from Stephens College in Missouri and from Stanford University with honors, she went to Virginia Beach to meet Edgar's son Hugh Lynn Cayce and study the readings. She initially studied readings for people who had lived at the time of Jesus. This enhanced her commitment to and her love of Jesus and Bible history. For many years now, Meredith has been coordinator of prayer services and the prison program for the Association for Research and Enlightenment, Inc.

Cucchi's works are painterly, intuitive, and energetic. His technique is often childlike and awkward, but visually exciting. His sources appear to come from his own visions, the traditions of Italian painting, and his provincial experiences. The essay by Waldman is a little disappointing; her efforts to link Cucchi with both the beginnings of modernism and the Italian masters from Giotto to Caravaggio are not always convincing. The strongest part of the book are the illustrations, reproduced quite well, which convey the powerful, visionary, and disturbing qualities of Cucchi's art.

For the Chinese, there seemed only one solution: to turn their country into a vast fortress. </p><p> <b>The Great Wall</b> chronicles a people's struggle for absolute security in a violent and dangerous world.

Detailed illustrations chronicle the Chinese people's attempts to foil violence by erecting the wall; millions of Chinese lugged stones, day in and day out, for over 200 years, to build a fortress 30 feet high over thousands of miles. A large center fold-out illustrates what an attack on the Great Wall might have looked like in the mountains north of Peking. A timeline illustrates Mongol invasions in the 13th century; a map shows the location of the Great Wall dividing China from the north where the Mongols and the Manchus roamed the steppe. A thoughtful discussion about the life of nomadic tribes on the steppe and their difference from the Chinese people illustrates how cultures distrust and fear one another: ``Order, harmony, and stability were important to the Chinese. They looked down on the nomads and their wandering, warlike ways. They called them barbarians.'' Mann makes thrilling the ironies of the Great Wall: It never fulfilled its purpose of providing safety by exclusion, and contributed to the downfall of the Ming dynasty because of its enormous cost.

Andree and the Heroic Age of Arctic Exploration</h2><p>In this grand and astonishing tale, Alec Wilkinson brings us the story of S. A. Andr�e, the visionary Swedish aeronaut who, in 1897, during the great age of Arctic endeavor, left to discover the North Pole by flying to it in a hydrogen balloon. Called by a British military officer &#x201c;the most original and remarkable attempt ever made in Arctic exploration,&#x201d; Andr�e&#x2019;s expedition was followed by nearly the entire world, and it made him an international legend.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>The Ice Balloon</i> begins in the late nineteenth century, when nations, compelled by vanity, commerce, and science, competed with one another for the greatest discoveries, and newspapers covered every journey. Wilkinson describes how in Andr�e several contemporary themes intersected. He was the first modern explorer&#x2014;the first to depart for the Arctic unencumbered by notions of the Romantic age, and the first to be equipped with the newest technologies. No explorer had ever left with more uncertainty regarding his fate, since none had ever flown over the horizon and into the forbidding region of ice.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to portraying the period, <i>The Ice Balloon</i> gives us a brief history of the exploration of the northern polar regions, both myth and fact, including detailed versions of the two record-setting expeditions just prior to Andr�e&#x2019;s&#x2014;one led by U.S. Army lieutenant Adolphus Greely from Ellesmere Island; the other by Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian explorer who initially sought to reach the pole by embedding his ship in the pack ice and drifting toward it with the current.<br> &nbsp;<br> Woven throughout is Andr�e&#x2019;s own history, and how he came by his brave and singular idea. We also get to know Andr�e&#x2019;s family, the woman who loves him, and the two men who accompany him&#x2014;Nils Strindberg, a cousin of the famous playwright, with a tender love affair of his own, and Knut Fraenkel, a willing and hearty young man.<br> &nbsp;<br> Andr�e&#x2019;s flight and the journey, based on the expedition&#x2019;s diaries and photographs, dramatically recovered thirty-three years after the balloon came down, along with Wilkinson&#x2019;s research, provide a book filled with suspense and adventure, a haunting story of high ambition and courage, made tangible with the detail, beauty, and devastating conditions of traveling and dwelling in &#x201c;the realm of Death,&#x201d; as one Arctic explorer put it.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, January 2012</strong>: Before the twentieth century, more than a thousand people tried to reach the (north) pole,&#x201d; Alec Wilkinson writes in his entertaining new book. Most of those attempts were by ship, sled, and foot. The odds of reaching the pole alive were terrible. About three-fourths of those explorers died. But that one-in-four chance of success didn&#x2019;t deter Swedish explorer S.A. Andree, who in 1897 attempted the most unlikely means of reaching the North Pole: by hydrogen balloon. What makes this more than another adventure story is Wilkinson&#x2019;s exploration of mankind&#x2019;s compulsion to reach the extreme points of the Earth, despite all the absurd and obvious risks.<em> --Neal Thompson</em><br><b>Alec Wilkinson</b> began writing for <i>The New Yorker </i>in 1980.

With no apparent reason to feel hopeful, he continues his exploration of and love for books and reading. Gradually his writing changes; his relationship with the world around him changes too.

Dwike is Dwike Mitchell, the Florida-born jazz pianist who is Ruff&#39;s longtime partner in a traveling/teaching duo. And this often-captivating profile begins with as short opening 1981 chapter that overshadows everything that follows: a mesmerizing evocation of &#34;&#34;the first American jazz concert ever presented to the Chinese&#34;&#34;--with Willie and Dwike in Shanghai, taking a Conservatory of Music from the very basics of jazz (Willie genially lecturing in Mandarin) to the highest of musical highs (improvising on a Chinese melody they&#39;ve never heard before). After that, perhaps inevitably, the narrative is less steadily compelling. Three chapters fill in background: the two musicians&#39; childhoods; their informal/ haphazard early musical studies; their intense musical education (and familial joy) as part of the 1940s band at Lockboune Air Force Base--where they met. And though much of the detail here is engaging, this section suffers a bit from over-reliance on the traditional New Yorker profile style (long blocks of quoted reminiscence) and some uninspired Zinsser prose. (&#34;&#34;Music was literally in the air during Ruff&#39;s boyhood. . .&#34;&#34;) Then, however, it&#39;s back to the 1980s--for five days with Willie and Dwike as they come as &#34;&#34;visiting artists&#34;&#34; to four small Iowa cities: concerts with bad pianos, with students eating lunch (&#34;&#34;Mitchell is probing the keyboard like a doctor examining a dying patient for some signs of life&#34;&#34;); a glum master class, but more than a few moments of stirring education/entertainment breakthrough--with eloquent dramatization of the importance of community-arts programs. And the final two chapters focus first on pianist Mitchell (his Manhattan teaching, his father&#39;s death), then on horn-player Ruff--who goes to Venice and, while recalling the influence of Hindemith and Stravinsky, realizes his dream of playing his horn in St. Mark&#39;s cathedral at night, recording the accoustical effect. Despite the limitations of the format, with less than we want to know in some places and the opposite in others: a warm, vivid double-portrait--for jazz fans, anyone interested in cultural education, and others too.</p><h2>Scandalous Desires (Maiden Lane, 3)</h2><p><strong>CAN A PIRATE LEARN . . .</strong><br><br>River pirate "Charming" Mickey O'Connor has lifted himself from the depths of the slums to be the king of St. Giles.

Between Venice and Vienna, with Trieste as its capital, this region has the most varied and sophisticated food in Italy. No other regional kitchen uses more fruit or spices or a greater range of meat and seafood. In <b>La Terra Fortunata</b>, readers will discover gnocchi filled with plums or apricots; tagliolini tossed with poppy seeds and the region&#x2019;s superlative prosciutto di San Daniele; sea scallops with almond sauce; risotto flavored with a rainbow of spices, including ginger, star anise, and nutmeg; cinnamon-scented veal stew, and, of course, frico, the region's signature dish, a delectable cheese crisp that is positively addictive.<br><br>Since Friuli-Venezia Giulia produces Italy's top white wines and outstanding reds, with more varieties than any other region in Italy, Fred Plotkin has included the most detailed list of the region's wines and their makers ever compiled.<br><br>With more than 160 recipes and an indispensable list for wine lovers, <b>La Terra Fortunata </b>will come as a revelation to those who thought there was nothing new under the Italian sun.</p><p>The Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia is perhaps the least well known by Americans. Tucked away in the northeastern corner of Italy, stretching almost from Venice to Vienna, the region proudly grows the widest range of grape varieties in all of Italy. The Friulians, therefore, are extraordinarily aware of the interaction between food and wine. Fred Plotkin wrote <i>La Terra Fortunata</i> after 25 years of visiting the small region. His knowledge of its food, its wine, and its people and their customs is immense. Plotkin offers a comprehensive history of the region and great insight and understanding in his choice of recipes and their instructions. <p> There are few generalities that can be used to describe this collection. Friulians are great wine drinkers and have a reputation for working hard, and so have a custom of eating small dishes to wash down with their wine and to satisfy their hunger between meals. So it's no surprise that many of these dishes can be served alongside one another. The herbs and spices used are not necessarily those we think of as Italian; they are much more international. Yogurt-Dill Sauce sounds Greek and Mustard-Wine Sauce sounds French, but both they and Montasio-Mint Sauce can be found in Friuli (the Montasio cheese gets just a hint of mint, beautiful on pasta or soft polenta). From a garlicky Mussel Frittata to the most traditional <i>Frico Croccante</i> (a thin crispy pancake made entirely of cheese, it makes a delicious cup for Gnocchi with Mountain Herbs or Risotto with Crabmeat and Peas), Plotkin's recipes are flavorful, unusual, and well explained. Because the region stretches from the coast to the mountains, traditional cooking includes everything from seafood to game and every herb, vegetable, and fruit under the sun. Plotkin introduces every recipe with a story, and they, along with his guide to Friulian wines, make <i>La Terra Fortunata</i> an indispensable guidebook both for the cook and for the armchair traveler. <i>--Leora Y. Bloom</i></p>When the subject is Italian food and wine, Fred Plotkin is the expert other experts turn to for definitive information. A finalist for both the James Beard and Julia Child cookbook awards, his previous book, <b>Recipes from Paradise: Life and Food on the Italian Riviera</b>, placed first on the <i>New York Times</i> listing of the top cookbooks of 1997.

The procedure called "photoluminescence"stimulates the body's own immune responses. A proven therapy that uses the healing power of light to perform almost miraculous cures. Dr. Douglass explains how light therapy works to treat allergies, chronic fatigue, cancer, and other diseases. It's unthinkable that what could be the best solution ever to stopping the world's killer diseases is being ignored, scorned, and rejected. But that is exactly what's happening. 50 years ago, it virtually disappeared from the halls of medicine. Why has this incredible cure been ignored by the medical authorities of this country? You'll find the shocking answer here in the pages of this new edition of "Into the Light". Join Dr. Douglass in seeking to effect the widespread implementation of this miraculous technology, and to explore its possibilities even further. Realizing those possibilities will mean the difference between health and sickness - and often, life and death - to millions of people. But it will mean the difference on an even larger scale. In the face of the AIDS epidemic and the biological welfare, the very survival of our way of life is at stake. The key to the future health of our culture lies with widespread implementation of photoluminescence. The solution is there if you will seize the opportunity. You can't buy a phototherapy instrument needed for treatment. Your betters in Washington D &amp; C do not approve of the therapy. However, it is not against the law to buy the individual parts and make your own - it is remarkably simple for anyone with a little carpenter in him. And naturally, we have enclosed the drawings n the book that explain how to assemble it.</p><p>Dr. Douglass reveals medical truths, and deceptions, often at risk of being labeled heretical. He is consumed by a passion for living a long healthy life, and wants his readers to share that passion. Their health and well-being comes first. He is anti-dogmatic, and unwavering in his dedication to improve the quality of life of his readers. He has been called &#34;the conscience of modern medicine,&#34; a &#34;medical maverick,&#34; and his medical experiences are far reaching-from battling malaria in Central America - to fighting deadly epidemics at his own health clinic in Africa - to flying with U.S. Navy crews as a flight surgeon - to working for 10 years in emergency medicine in the United States. This dedicated physician has repeatedly gone far beyond the call of duty in his work to spread the truth about integrating the best science-based medical therapies from all medical disciplines (&#34;alternative medicine&#34;). For a full year, he endured economic and physical hardship to work with physicians at the Pasteur Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, where advanced research on photoluminescence was being conducted. These learning experiences and his keen storytelling ability and wit make Dr. Douglass&#39; numerous books on this website and his newsletters - The Douglass Report and Daily Dose - uniquely interesting and fun to read. He shares his no-frills, &#34;no-bull&#34; approach to health care, often amazing his readers by telling them to ignore many widely-hyped good-health practices (like staying away from red meat, avoiding coffee, and eating like a bird), and start living again by eating REAL food, taking some inexpensive supplements, and doing the pleasurable things that make life livable. Readers of Dr. Douglass� books and newsletters get all this, plus they learn how to burn fat, prevent heart disease and cancer, boost libido, and so much more. And Dr. Douglass is not afraid to debunk latest research reports that are published, and share the real story with his readers. He has led a colorful, rebellious, and crusading life! Not many physicians would dare put their professional reputations on the line as many times as this courageous healer has. A vocal opponent of &#34;business-as-usual&#34; medicine, Dr. Douglass has championed patients&#39; rights and physician commitment to wellness throughout his career.</p><h2>44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove, Book 4)</h2><p>44 Cranberry Point by Debbie Macomber released on Aug 25, 2004 is available now for purchase.</p><p>Debbie Macomber is a #1 New York Times bestselling author and a leading voice in women&#x2019;s fiction worldwide.

This was her private place, her one true source of serenity. The fresh briny scent of the water off Puget Sound drifted toward her as she watched the Washington State ferry glide from Bremerton toward Seattle on its sixty-minute journey. This was a typical May afternoon in Cedar Cove&#x2014;comfortably warm with just a hint of a breeze.<br><br>Peggy uncoiled the garden hose and moved carefully between the rows of leaf lettuce, sweet peas and pole beans. She had a strong practical streak, expressed in her vegetable and herb gardens; she satisfied her craving for beauty with the flower gardens in front. Looking back at the house that always had been her dream, Peggy smiled. She'd grown up in Cedar Cove, graduated from the local high school and married Bob Beldon on his return from Vietnam. The early years had been difficult because of Bob's reliance on alcohol. But then, to her eternal gratitude, he'd discovered Alcoholics Anonymous; it had saved their marriage and quite possibly Bob's life. Until AA, Bob had spent most nights drinking, by himself or with friends. When he drank, he became a different person, no longer the man she'd married. She didn't like to think about that time. Thankfully, her husband had remained sober for twenty-one years.<br><br>Walking between the rows, Peggy gently watered the seedlings. Several years earlier, Bob had accepted early retirement and with the severance package, they'd purchased the house on Cranberry Point. Peggy had loved it for as long as she could remember. Situated on a point of land overlooking Sinclair Inlet, the two-story structure, built in the late 1930s, had seemed like a mansion to her. Over the years, it had changed owners a number of times and had started to deteriorate, since no one had cared enough to provide the maintenance it needed. By straining their finances, Bob and Peggy had managed to buy it for a price far below its current market value.<br><br>Her husband was a talented handyman and within a few months they were able to hang out a sign for their Bed and Breakfast. Peggy hadn't known how much business to expect, how many guests would be attracted to the Thyme and Tide B and B, as they'd called it. She'd hoped, of course, that they'd make enough to supplement their retirement income&#x2014; and they had. She was proud of the success they'd achieved. Their traditional home, warm hospitality and her cooking had brought them steady customers and a growing reputation. They'd even been reviewed in a national magazine, which had reserved its highest praise for the food, especially her baking. The reviewer had spent two whole sentences describing her blueberry muffins and homemade fruit cobbler. She had twenty blueberry bushes and eight raspberry canes, and she pampered them lovingly. Each summer she was rewarded with an ample supply for her guests and her family. Life had seemed about as perfect as it could get.<br><br>Then the unimaginable happened.<br><br>More than a year ago, a stranger had knocked on their door in the middle of a dark, stormy night. If it hadn't been so clich�d she might've been amused, but this was no laughing matter. The man had rented a room and then promptly locked himself inside.<br><br>A hundred times since, Peggy had regretted not insisting he complete the usual paperwork. It was late, and he'd seemed so tired that they'd simply shown him to his room. They could deal with the necessities in the morning, over breakfast.<br><br>But by morning, the stranger was dead.<br><br>Ever since, Peggy had felt as if they were caught in some kind of whirlwind, tossed about by forces beyond their control. Bad enough that the man had died in their home, but then they'd learned that he'd carried false identification. Nothing was as it seemed. By the end of that day, after hours with the sheriff and the coroner, there'd been more questions than answers.<br><br>She saw Bob pull the riding lawn mower out of the garage. At the sound of the engine, Peggy paused in watering her seedlings, one hand shading her eyes. Even after all these years of marriage, she never grew tired of their life together. They'd survived the bad times with their love intact. And their attraction, too. Bob was tall and had kept his shape, his sandy brown hair neatly trimmed. His arms were already tanned from exposure to the sun. He loved his workshop and she was genuinely impressed by what he could do with a few pieces of oak or pine. She'd fallen in love with Bob Beldon as a teenager and she loved him still.<br><br>Now, however, she was worried. She didn't want to think about the dead man, but it was unavoidable, especially after what they'd recently found out. Sheriff Davis had identified their mystery guest as Maxwell Russell. To say Bob was shocked would be putting it mildly. He'd been with Max in Vietnam. Dan Sherman, who was also dead, Bob, Max and another man named Stewart Samuels had belonged to that squadron. They'd gotten lost in a Southeast Asian jungle with tragic results.<br><br>Once the identity of the dead man was established, another shocking revelation had come to light. The sheriff, with the help of local private investigator Roy McAfee, had discovered that Max Russell's death was no accident.<br><br>He'd been poisoned.<br><br>The water bottle he'd carried with him had been laced with odorless, tasteless Rohypnol, commonly known as the "date rape" drug. The dose had been large enough to stop his heart. Maxwell Russell had gone to bed, tired from a long day of travel, and he never woke up.<br><br>Bob rode past her on the lawn mower with a quick wave, and Peggy continued to water her garden, but a pang went through her. At this very moment Bob could be in danger, but he seemed content to ignore any risk rather than admit her concerns were legitimate.<br><br>As she set aside the hose, Peggy caught sight of Sheriff Davis's patrol car coming down Cranberry Point. She immediately felt the tension between her shoulder blades. She hoped he planned to talk some sense into Bob.<br><br>Her husband must have seen the patrol car at the same time Peggy did because he cut the engine and climbed off the lawn mower. Sheriff Troy Davis turned into the driveway, then stepped out of his vehicle. In the beginning, when it looked like Bob might be a suspect in the murder case, Davis wasn't nearly as welcome here as he was now.<br><br>The sheriff, who was probably a little heavier than he should be, took a moment to hike up his pants and adjust his gun before heading across the lawn to meet Bob. Unwilling to be left out of the conversation, Peggy shut off the water and hurried across the half-mown grass.<br><br>"Peggy." Davis touched the brim of his hat and nodded in her direction. "I was just telling Bob it might be a good idea if the three of us sat down and talked."<br><br>Peggy nodded in return, appreciating the fact that he wanted to include her.<br><br>Bob led the way to the patio, and Peggy was grateful she'd taken time that morning to sweep it off. The three of them sat at the round pine table Bob had built several years earlier. He'd painted it a deep gray-blue, a color that complemented the white siding. The striped umbrella was up and the patio was awash in sunshine.<br><br>"I thought I'd update you on my conversation with Hannah Russell."<br><br>A couple of months earlier, after Max's identity had been uncovered, his daughter had asked to meet with Bob and Peggy. It had been an uncomfortable meeting, but Peggy's heart had ached for the young woman. She'd answered Hannah's questions to the best of her ability.<br><br>For her part, there was little Hannah could tell them. All she knew was what her father had told her&#x2014;he was taking a short trip, although he hadn't divulged where. That was the last she'd heard. When he didn't return to California, she'd filed a missing persons report with the police. A year had passed before she learned his fate.<br><br>"I feel so bad for her," Peggy said. Hannah had lost her mother some time before and was now an orphan with no other family.<br><br>"She was pretty upset," Troy admitted. "You can imagine how painful it was to learn her father was dead. But to discover he'd been murdered..." He shook his head.<br><br>"Did she have any idea who might've done this?"<br><br>"None," Davis told them. "She asked me to thank you for your kindness. Talking with you helped her resolve in her own mind what happened to her father. Peggy, she mentioned the letter you wrote, and I could tell it meant a great deal to her."<br><br>Peggy bit her lip. "How's she getting on with her life?"<br><br>The sheriff hesitated. "I can't really say. She said she no longer has any reason to stay in California and implied that she's thinking of moving. I asked her to keep in touch and she promised she would."<br><br>Peggy could understand the young woman's feelings. With both of her parents gone, Hannah was rootless. Peggy sympathized with her desire to leave the area where she'd grown up, where she was surrounded by so many memories. Every place she turned, every place she looked, Hannah must be reminded of the parents she'd loved.<br><br>"What did you find out about Colonel Samuels?" Bob asked, eyes narrowed as he gazed at Troy Davis.<br><br>Stewart Samuels was the fourth man in Vietnam with Bob and Dan and Max. Peggy knew the sheriff had recently been in contact with him. The colonel had been cleared in Max's murder, at least as far as Davis was concerned, but her husband obviously had doubts. While Bob and the other two were eager to be discharged, back in the early seventies, Samuels had stayed in the Army and risen through the ranks.<br><br>"At this point I don't consider the colonel a suspect."<br><br>"He's some mucky-muck in Army Intelligence from what I hear," Bob muttered, as if that should be motive enough.<br><br>"Who lives in the Washington, D.C., area," Sheriff Davis stated calmly. "I've had him checked out by a number of people. He's highly respected. He's been cooperative and willing to help in any way he can. Perhaps you should talk to him yourself, Bob."<br><br>Her husband declined with a sharp shake of his head. Bob wanted as little to do with the past as possible. Coping with what had happened to Dan, who'd committed suicide, and to Max, had been hard enough. The less he had to think about the past, or its effect on the present, the better.<br><br>"Is Bob in danger?" Peggy asked bluntly. Her husband might prefer not to acknowledge the likelihood of a threat, but Peggy wanted a realistic assessment of their situation.<br><br>"I think he might be at risk," the sheriff said quietly.<br><br>It wasn't what Peggy had hoped to hear, but she was grateful for his frankness. They had to face the truth, however unpleasant, and take appropriate precautions.<br><br>"Nonsense," Bob insisted. "If anyone wanted me dead, I'd be six feet under by now."<br><br>Maybe, but Peggy wasn't willing to take chances with her husband's life.<br><br>"Why don't we arrange an extended vacation?" she suggested. It'd been years since they'd been away from the Bed and Breakfast, and they could use a break.<br><br>"For how long?" Bob asked.<br><br>"Until the case is solved," Peggy told him, pleading with her eyes. This wasn't the time to put on a brave front&#x2014;not in her opinion, anyway.<br><br>"No way." Bob's quick refusal shouldn't have come as any surprise. He'd been quite content to live in denial. Denial and featherbeds! <em>Someone </em>had to point out the very real possibility that he was in danger and because he was, so was she.<br><br>"I'm not leaving Cedar Cove."<br><br>"Now, Bob..."<br><br>"I won't let anyone or anything drive me out of my own home."<br><br>A chill shot up Peggy's spine. "But&#x2014;"<br><br>"No, Peg," he said, and his face hardened with resolve. "How long are we supposed to stay away? One month? Two?" He paused. "More than that?"<br><br>It wasn't a question Troy could answer.<br><br>"Max was found dead over a year ago. I was supposedly in danger then, right?"<br><br>Sheriff Davis exchanged a concerned look with Peggy. "I understand what you're saying, but we didn't know then what we know now."<br><br>"I'm not running! I spent half my life running, and I won't do it again. If somebody wants me dead, then so be it."<br><br>Peggy gasped.<br><br>"I'm sorry, honey," her husband said, stretching his arm across the table to clasp her fingers with his. "I refuse to live like that, looking over my shoulder all the time."<br><br>"Then perhaps you could compromise," Davis said. "There's no need to invite someone into your home who might want to harm you."<br><br>"What do you mean?" Bob leaned closer, his stomach pressed against the rounded edge of the pinewood table. Peggy realized that despite his defiant words he was afraid. His body language revealed what he was unwilling to admit.<br><br>"I don't know how many reservations you have for the B and B, but I'd advise you to not take any more."<br><br>"We can easily cancel the ones we have," Peggy murmured. Any number of businesses in town would welcome the additional bookings.<br><br>Bob directed his gaze at Peggy. "Would that make you more comfortable?"<br><br>She swallowed and nodded.<br><br>Bob continued to look unsure, as if even this one concession was more than he felt inclined to make.<br><br>"I've been worried ever since Jack and Olivia's wedding," she whispered.<br><br>A week earlier, Bob had stood up as Jack Griffin's best man. That was just a day or two before they'd learned Max Russell had been murdered.<br><br>"All right." Bob's voice was heavy with reluctance. "We'll cancel the reservations."<br><br>"No guests," Peggy said.<br><br>"No guests," he confirmed, "until this matter is settled once and for all."<br><br>This was going to hurt financially, but it didn't matter. What did matter was having the reassurance that her husband was safe.<br><br>"I'll do what I can to solve this quickly," Troy promised them.<br><br>Peggy could only wonder how long that would take.<br><br></p><h2>Next of Kin</h2><p>When Boston attorney Scott Finn agrees to defend the son of notorious mobster Eamonn McDougal, he knows he&#39;s putting his reputation on the line. But he also knows he can use him as bait to reel in the prize catch. In a city where mob crime once ruled, a core of corruption, greed, lies and deceit still lingers. And it seems there are those in power who will stop at nothing to achieve what they want. Finn, who grew up an orphan on the meanest streets in the city, is determined to solve the murder of the mother he never knew. In his search for the truth he uncovers a sinister trail of murder, betrayal and revenge borne by someone who could neither forgive nor forget. But who can be trusted, and who can be believed?

All the evidence said Caroline Crale poisoned her philandering husband, a brilliant painter. She was quickly and easily convicted and sentenced to life in prison. <p></p><p><br> Now, sixteen years later, in a posthumous letter, Mrs. Crale has assured her grown daughter that she was innocent. But instead of setting the young woman's mind at ease, the letter only raises disquieting questions. Did Caroline indeed write the truth? And if she didn't kill her husband, who did? </p><p><br> To find out, the Crale&#x2019;s daughter asks Hercule Poirot to reopen the case. His investigation takes him deep into the conflicting memories and motivations of the five other people who were with the Crales on the fatal day. With his keen understanding of human psychology, he manages to discover the surprising truth behind the artist's death. </p></p><p><p>Beautiful Caroline Crale was convicted of poisoning her husband, but just like the nursery rhyme, there were five other &#x201c;little pigs&#x201d; who could have done it: Philip Blake (the stockbroker), who went to market; Meredith Blake (the amateur herbalist), who stayed at home; Elsa Greer (the three-time divorc�e), who had her roast beef; Cecilia Williams (the devoted governess), who had none; and Angela Warren (the disfigured sister), who cried all the way home.</p><p>Sixteen years later, Caroline&#x2019;s daughter is determined to prove her mother&#x2019;s innocence, and Poirot just can&#x2019;t get that nursery rhyme out of his mind.</p>Agatha Christie was born in 1890 and created the detective Hercule Poirot in her debut novel, <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i> (1920).

One of these, BILL PEET: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, was named a 1989 Caldecott Honor Book. All of Bill Peet's books published by Houghton Mifflin Company, including his first book for children published in 1959, HUBERT'S HAIR-RAISING ADVENTURE, remain actively in print today. <br><br>In both his career as an author and illustrator of children's books and in his work as sketch artist and continuity illustrator at Walt Disney, Bill Peet created a menagerie of memorable characters. As he himself noted, "I write about animals because I love to draw them. Most of my animal characters have human personalities, and some are much like the people I know."<br><br>At Walt Disney, where Bill Peet worked for 27 years, he was a key participant in the production of classic films such as Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and 101 Dalmatians for which he was not only an artist, but the screenwriter as well. <br><br>Bill Peet's signature style enabled him to create fast-paced stories of fantastical adventure delivered with warmth and laugh-out-loud hilarity. His unfailing humor did not, however, prevent him from addressing such poignant issues as kindness toward others and respect for the environment.

As the city simmered with racial tension over forced school busing, newsman Stanley Forman photographed a white protester outside City Hall assaulting an African American attorney with the American flag. The photo shocked Boston, made front pages across the U.S. and won a Pulitzer Prize. Acclaimed historian Louis P. Masur has done extensive research, including personal interviews with those involved, to reveal the unknown story of what really happened that day and afterward. This evocative "biography of a photograph" unpacks this arresting image to trace the lives of the men who intersected at that moment, to examine the power of photography and the meaning of the flag, and to reveal how a single picture helped change race relations in Boston and America. <i>The Soiling of Old Glory</i>, like the photograph itself, offers a dramatic window onto the turbulence of the 1970s and race relations in America.</p><p>Louis P. Masur is William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of American Institutions and Values at Trinity College in Hartford. He is the editor of Reviews in American History, the premier book review journal in its field. His books include <i>1831: Year of Eclipse</i> and <i>Autumn Glory: Baseball's First World Series</i>."A moving reminder of a painful episode in American history.""--Kirkus Reviews" <br>"Most historians begin with a large argument or theory, then attempt to demonstrate its relevance within a specific context. Louis Masur reverses this interpretive process, beginning with a very specific incident - in this case a racially charged moment in Boston in 1976 - then spreading outward to trace its origins, resonances and implications for the larger story. In order to do this well you need to know how to tell a story and write uncommonly well, both qualities that Masur possesses in abundance. In my judgment, he is the best there is at what he does." Joseph Ellis, author of "Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation "and "American Creation: Triumphs and Tragedies at the Founding of the Republic" <p><br>"In "The Soiling of Old Glory," Louis Masur is at his best, dissecting a single photographic frame to reveal its essential gravitas, humanity and inhumanity, and explaining how we see, interpret -- and misinterpret -- imagery in the modern age." -- David Friend, editor at Vanity Fair and author of "Watching the World Change: The Stories Behind the Images of 9/11" </p><p><br>"Louis Masur's vivid and compelling book provides depth and breadth to this haunting, horrific, photograph. He carefully situates this image into significant contexts: Boston's racial tensions, the symbolic power of the flag, and the photograph's connection with other visual icons in our history. "The Soiling of Old Glory" helps readers appreciate not only the public life of this picture, but its impact on those forever associated with it." - Edward T. Linenthal, author of "The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City inAmerican Memory" </p><p><br>"Louis Masur has written an indispensable history about an unforgettable image. With admirable empathy and grace, he reveals why racial conflict in modern America is both so compelling and so difficult to resolve." -Michael Kazin, author of "A Godly Hero: The Life of William Jennings Bryan" </p><p><br>"Louis P. Masur's fine-grained study of the Boston school bussing violence and the Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph that memorialized it is grassroots visual culture at its finest. The anatomy of an icon!" - Karal Ann Marling, author "Old Glory: Unfurling History" and" As Seen on TV: The Visual Culture of Everyday Life in the 1950s" </p><p><br>"Louis P. Masur's deep contextual reading of a single photograph that defined a painful historic moment for our nation is a surprising page-turner." - Margaret Sartor, author of "Miss American Pie" </p><p><br>"Lou Masur continues to write some of the freshest and most original work in American history. Each of his books has expanded the discipline, and "The Soiling of Old Glory" has taken "history" all the way into the present. With artistry, verve and impeccable research, he has written another jewel of a book, and opened up an entire world through a single image." - Ted Widmer, author of "Ark of the Liberties: America and the World"<br>"An elegantly reasoned, wonderfully researched and deeply moving new book...Masur's skill at teasing the symbolic resonance from the photo's structure and composition is impressive, as is his treatment of the flag as national icon. He displays his real skill as a historian, however, in his remarkably clear and fair-minded synopses of tangled racial histories. Boston's certainly is one of those, and you won't find a better or more crystalline account of it than in "The Soiling of Old Glory," His sketch of precisely how the Boston school crisis develops is a small model of detailed economy and essential context....Masur's elegantly clear-eyed analysis of this famous photo and the people and conditions that actually produced it proffers, if not a counter maximum, a parallel one: All politics are local until they become symbolic -- and then they belong to us all."--Tim Rutten, "Los Angeles"" Times"</p><p>"Masur examines the photograph's visual power and provides an informed deconstruction of the image in terms of composition, texture and light. With his precise skills as a cultural historian, Masur probes deeper, analyzing the photograph's role in the emotional collision of civil-rights activism with continued racism and the resulting changes in the community...a fascinating look at both the sacred and profane ways the flag has been portrayed in the name of artistic expression and the legislative attempts to limit them...Sharp and vivid."--Ann E. Yow, "Seattle"" Times"</p><p>"An engaging book for anyone interested in journalism, photography, history or social themes, as--like a photograph--it reflects the actions and attitudes of America at a distinctive place and time."--John T. Slania,"BookPage"</p><p>"This disparity between actual event and photographic appearance is what makes "The Soiling of Old Glory" read at times like a mystery story, as we wait to hear that over time the truth of the image has silted out into our cultural consciousness."--Andy Grundberg, "American Scholar""It's a story not just of a photograph but of a deeply troubled period in American history, and it is a compelling book. "--"Booklist" (starred review)</p><p>"Masur is superb when deconstructing the photo, pointing out the elements of its composition that infused it with meaning, while at the same time asking provocative questions that illuminate how the interpretation of a photograph can affect our perception of an event. Equally compelling is Masur's discussion of the shifting and potent historical symbolism of the American flag, which stands at the metaphorical center of the photo."--"Publishers Weekly" (starred review)</p><p>"A moving reminder of a painful episode in American history.""--Kirkus Reviews"</p><p>"Most historians begin with a large argument or theory, then attempt to demonstrate its relevance within a specific context.

No one hears the twigs snapping under the north wind, or the telltale guttural moaning noises, as faint as loons behind the treetops. No one detects the trace odors of putrid meat and black mold marinating in feces. The tang of autumn wood smoke and rotting fruit on the mid-afternoon breeze masks the smell of the walking dead.</p><p>In fact, for quite a while, not a single one of the settlers in the burgeoning encampment registers any imminent danger whatsoever&#x2014;most of the survivors now busily heaving up support beams hewn from found objects such as railroad ties, telephone poles, and rusty lengths of rebar.</p><p>&#x201c;Pathetic&nbsp;... look at me,&#x201d; the slender young woman in the ponytail comments with an exasperated groan, crouching awkwardly by a square of paint-spattered tent canvas folded on the ground over by the northwest corner of the lot. She shivers in her bulky Georgia Tech sweatshirt, antique jewelry, and ripped jeans. Ruddy and freckled, with long, deep brown hair that dangles in tendrils wound with delicate little feathers, Lilly Caul is a bundle of nervous tics, from the constant yanking of stray wisps of hair back behind her ears to the compulsive gnawing of fingernails. Now, with her small hand she clutches the hammer tighter and repeatedly whacks at the metal stake, grazing the head as if the thing is greased.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Lilly, just relax,&#x201d; the big man says, looking on from behind her.</p><p>&#x201c;A two-year-old could do this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop beating yourself up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not me I want to beat up.&#x201d; She pounds some more, two-handing the hammer. The stake goes nowhere. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s this stupid stake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re choked up too high on the hammer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Move your hand more toward the end of the handle, let the tool do the work.&#x201d;</p><p>More pounding.</p><p>The stake jumps off hard ground, goes flying, and lands ten feet away.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn it! Damn it!&#x201d; Lilly hits the ground with the hammer, looks down and exhales.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re doing fine, babygirl, lemme show you.&#x201d;</p><p>The big man moves in next to her, kneels, and starts to gently take the hammer from her. Lilly recoils, refusing to hand over the implement. &#x201c;Give me a second, okay? I can handle this, I can,&#x201d; she insists, her narrow shoulders tensing under the sweatshirt.</p><p>She grabs another stake and starts again, tapping the metal crown tentatively. The ground resists, as tough as cement. It&#x2019;s been a cold October so far, and the fallow fields south of Atlanta have hardened. Not that this is a bad thing. The tough clay is also porous and dry&#x2014;for the moment at least&#x2014;hence the decision to pitch camp here. Winter&#x2019;s coming, and this contingent has been regrouping here for over a week, settling in, recharging, rethinking their futures&#x2014;if indeed they have any futures.</p><p>&#x201c;You kinda just let the head fall on it,&#x201d; the burly African-American demonstrates next to her, making swinging motions with his enormous arm. His huge hands look as though they could cover her entire head. &#x201c;Use gravity and the weight of the hammer.&#x201d;</p><p>It takes a great deal of conscious effort for Lilly not to stare at the black man&#x2019;s arm as it pistons up and down. Even crouching in his sleeveless denim shirt and ratty down vest, Josh Lee Hamilton cuts an imposing figure. Built like an NFL tackle, with monolithic shoulders, enormous tree-trunk thighs, and thick neck, he still manages to carry himself quite gently. His sad, long-lashed eyes and his deferential brow, which perpetually creases the front of his balding pate, give off an air of unexpected tenderness. &#x201c;No big deal&nbsp;... see?&#x201d; He shows her again and his tattooed bicep&#x2014;as big as a pig&#x2019;s belly&#x2014;jumps as he wields the imaginary hammer. &#x201c;See what I&#x2019;m sayin&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>Lilly discreetly looks away from Josh&#x2019;s rippling arm. She feels a faint frisson of guilt every time she notices his muscles, his tapered back, his broad shoulders. Despite the amount of time they have been spending together in this hell-on-earth some Georgians are calling &#x201c;the Turn,&#x201d; Lilly has scrupulously avoided crossing any intimate boundaries with Josh. Best to keep it platonic, brother-and-sister, best buds, nothing more. Best to keep it strictly business&nbsp;... especially in the midst of this plague.</p><p>But that has not stopped Lilly from giving the big man coy little sidelong grins when he calls her &#x201c;girlfriend&#x201d; or &#x201c;babydoll&#x201d;&nbsp;... or making sure he gets a glimpse of the Chinese character tattooed above Lilly&#x2019;s tailbone at night when she&#x2019;s settling into her sleeping bag. Is she leading him on? Is she manipulating him for protection? The rhetorical questions remain unanswered.</p><p>For Lilly the embers of fear constantly smoldering in her gut have cauterized all ethical issues and nuances of social behavior. In fact, fear has dogged her off and on for most her life&#x2014;she developed an ulcer in high school, and had to be on antianxiety meds during her aborted tenure at Georgia Tech&#x2014;but now it simmers constantly inside her. The fear poisons her sleep, clouds her thoughts, presses in on her heart. The fear makes her do things.</p><p>She seizes the hammer so tightly now it makes the veins twitch in her wrist.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not rocket science ferchrissake!&#x201d; she barks, and finally gets control of the hammer and drives a stake into the ground through sheer rage. She grabs another stake. She moves to the opposite corner of the canvas, and then wills the metal bit straight through the fabric and into the ground by pounding madly, wildly, missing as many blows as she connects. Sweat breaks out on her neck and brow. She pounds and pounds. She loses herself for a moment.</p><p>At last she pauses, exhausted, breathing hard, greasy with perspiration.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay&nbsp;... that&#x2019;s one way to do it,&#x201d; Josh says softly, rising to his feet, a smirk on his chiseled brown face as he regards the half-dozen stakes pinning the canvas to the ground. Lilly says nothing.</p><p>The zombies, coming undetected through the trees to the north, are now less than five minutes away.</p><p>Not a single one of Lilly Caul&#x2019;s fellow survivors&#x2014;numbering close to a hundred now, all grudgingly banding together to try and build a ragtag community here&#x2014;realizes the one fatal drawback to this vacant rural lot in which they&#x2019;ve erected their makeshift tents.</p><p>At first glance, the property appears to be ideal. Situated in a verdant area fifty miles south of the city&#x2014;an area that normally produces millions of bushels of peaches, pears, and apples annually&#x2014;the clearing sits in a natural basin of seared crabgrass and hard-packed earth. Abandoned by its onetime landlords&#x2014;probably the owners of the neighboring orchards&#x2014;the lot is the size of a soccer field. Gravel drives flank the property. Along these winding roads stand dense, overgrown walls of white pine and live oak that stretch up into the hills.</p><p>At the north end of the pasture stands the scorched, decimated remains of a large manor home, its blackened dormers silhouetted against the sky like petrified skeletons, its windows blown out by a recent maelstrom. Over the last couple of months, fires have taken out large chunks of the suburbs and farmhouses south of Atlanta.</p><p>Back in August, after the first human encounters with walking corpses, the panic that swept across the South played havoc with the emergency infrastructure. Hospitals got overloaded and then closed down, firehouses went dark, and Interstate 85 clogged up with wrecks. People gave up finding stations on their battery-operated radios, and then started looking for supplies to scavenge, places to loot, alliances to strike, and areas in which to hunker.</p><p>The people gathered here on this abandoned homestead found each other on the dusty back roads weaving through the patchwork tobacco farms and deserted strip malls of Pike, Lamar, and Meriwether counties. Comprising all ages, including over a dozen families with small children, their convoy of sputtering, dying vehicles grew&nbsp;... until the need to find shelter and breathing room became paramount.</p><p>Now they sprawl across this two-square-acre parcel of vacant land like a throwback to some depression-era Hooverville, some of them living in their cars, others carving out niches on the softer grass, a few of them already ensconced in small pup tents around the periphery. They have very few firearms, and very little ammunition. Garden implements, sporting goods, kitchen equipment&#x2014;all the niceties of civilized life&#x2014;now serve as weapons. Dozens of these survivors are still pounding stakes into the cold, scabrous ground, working diligently, racing some unspoken, invisible clock, struggling to erect their jury-rigged sanctuaries&#x2014;each one of them oblivious to the peril that approaches through the pines to the north.</p><p>One of the settlers, a lanky man in his mid-thirties in a John Deere cap and leather jacket, stands under the edge of a gigantic field of canvas in the center of the pasture, his chiseled features shaded by the gargantuan tent fabric. He supervises a group of sullen teenagers gathered under the canvas. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, ladies, put your backs into it!&#x201d; he barks, hollering over the din of clanging metal filling the chilled air.</p><p>The teens grapple with a massive wooden beam, which serves as the center mast of what is essentially a large circus tent. They found the tent back on I-85, strewn in a ditch next to an overturned ...</p></p><h2>The Return of the King (The Lord of the Rings, Part 3)</h2><p>The third volume in J.R.R.

Sat in the Pelican Tavern where they were first press-ganged, he wonders what future he has, lacking funds and an occupation if he leaves Navy, and without the evidence that would bring Captain Ralph Barclay to justice for perjury. Problems are mounting for Barclay as well. Emily, his young, estranged wife, is refusing to live under the same roof as him and intends to use the evidence Pearce thinks is lost to get her own way. What action will be necessary to silence those who spell trouble for Barclay?<br><br>Matters are looking up for Pearce when a smiling stranger offers him employment; the very profitable but illegal task of fetching a ship laden with contraband back from France. But is that smiling stranger all that he appears to be? How much danger is Emily Barclay in and are Pearce and his Pelicans sailing into prosperity or danger?</p><p><b>DAVID DONACHIE</b> was born in Edinburgh in 1944 and has had a variety of jobs, including selling everything from business machines to soap.

This novel won the Pulitzer Prize.</p><p>"Fascinating and unforgettable! A remarkable book, a spectacular book, a book that will not be forgotten!" -- "Chicago Tribune"<br><br>"I first read "Gone with the Wind" in grade school--a boy of the upper South who'd seen the great movie and felt compelled to learn what lay behind it, all thousand-plus pages worth. No page disappointed me. What other American novel surpasses its eagerness to tell a great story of love and war; what characters equal the cantankerous passions of Scarlett and Rhett? Even Scott Fitzgerald spoke well of it. What more could I ask, even seven decades later?" -- Reynolds Price<br><br>"GWTW is an indelible portrait of a unique time and place, American's greatest political and moral conflict, and the myths that surround it -- an all absorbing spectacle of a read even for postmodern readers. Mitchell vividly portrays the disillusionment and devastation of war, the ignorance of the uninitiated, and the transformation of arrogance into tenacity that shaped the first "new South." All the details of history and place come together as a rich backdrop for those unforgettable characters: shallow and selfish Scarlett, sincere Melanie, moony-eyed Ashley, and the sage, pragmatic, dashing, and rakish Rhett Butler--the most enduring heartthrob of American literature has produced. I'd reread the book for the thrill of Rhett alone!" -- Darnell Arnoult, author of "Sufficient Grace"<br><br>"In 1936 I was in E.M. Daggett Junior High in Ft. Worth, Texas. By some chance I was able to read "Gone with the Wind" early on. Then and now, I found it one of the great experiences of a young life. I still list it as one of my 10 favorite books." -- Liz Smith, nationally syndicated columnist<br><br>"Beyond a doubt one of the most remarkable first novels produced by an American writer. It is also one of the best." -- "The New York Times"<br><br>"Not just a great love story, "Gone with the Wind" is one of the most powerful anti-war novels ever written. Told from the standpoint of the women left behind, author Margaret Mitchell brilliantly illustrates the heartbreaking and devastating effects of war on the land and its people." -- Fannie Flagg, Academy Award nominated-author<br><br>"The best novel to have ever come out of the South...it is unsurpassed in the whole of American writing." -- "The Washington Post"<br><br>"Let's say you've read "Gone with the Wind" at least twice, and seen the movie over and again. So, here's a thought. Buy this handsome paperback edition, just for Pat Conroy's preface. This passionate, nearly breathless love letter is a Song of Solomon to Margaret Mitchell, Scarlett O'Hara, and Conroy's beautiful, GTW-obsessed mother. Indeed, his luminous preface packs a durable wallop, just like the epic Pulitzer prize-winning work that inspires it." -- Jan Karon, author of "The Mitford Years" series<br><br>"In my own personal life, I find many similarities to Scarlett's: The whole 17-inch waist thing notwithstanding, I do love a barbecue, both for the food and the men--I have been known to "eat like a field hand and gobble like a hawg"--I admit that at least on one occasion I may have feigned interest in some guy to further my own interests--I have fought tooth, toenail and tirelessly for my family--I learn slow but I learn good--and even so, I still adore the prospect of dealing with most things...Tomorrow." -- Jill Conner Browne, The Sweet Potato Queen, bestselling author of "The Sweet Potato Queens' First Big-Ass Novel"<br><br>""Gone with the Wind" is one of those rare books that we never forget. We read it when we're young and fall in love with the characters, then we watch the film and read the book again and watch the film again and never get tired of revisiting an era that is the most important in our history. Rhett and Scarlet and Melanie and Ashley and Big Sam and Mammy and Archie the convict are characters who always remain with us, in the same way that Twain's characters do. No one ever forgets the scene when Scarlet wanders among the wounded in the Atlanta train yard; no one ever forgets the moment Melanie and Scarlet drag the body of the dead Federal soldier down the staircase, a step at a time. "Gone with the Wind" is an epic story. Anyone who has not read it has missed one of the greatest literary experiences a reader can have." -- James Lee Burke, bestselling author of "The Tin Roof Blowdown "One of the most famous love stories of all time</p><h2>War Poems of Siegfried Sassoon</h2><p>At the dawn of World War I, poet Sassoon exchanged his pastoral pursuits of cricket, fox-hunting, and romantic verse for army life amid the muddy trenches of France. This collection of his epigrammatic and satirical poetry conveys the shocking brutality and pointlessness of the Great War and includes &#34;Counter-Attack,&#34; &#34;&#39;They,&#34; &#34;The General,&#34; and &#34;Base Details.&#34;</p><p>The celebrated British poet, editor, critic, novelist, and diarist Siegfried Sassoon (1886-1967) enlisted for military service on the first day of World War I; his friends in the service included Robert Graves and Wilfred Owen. Sassoon&#39;s war poems were originally published in &#34;The Old Huntsman&#34; (1917) and &#34;Counter-Attack&#34; (1918). After the war, he went on to write several other books of poetry and criticism, as well as six volumes of prose autobiography.&#x201c;In later years, when Siegfried Sassoon had written much else in prose and verse, he was annoyed at always being referred to simply as a war poet, but it was the Great War that turned him into a poet of international fame, and I feel sure that his ghost will forgive me for thus bringing together these magnificently scarifying poems.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Rupert Hart-Davis, from his Introduction</i></p><h2>Surfers Soulies Skinheads and Skaters: Subcultural Style from the Forties to the Nineties</h2><p>As bold and vital as the styles that inspired it, Surfers, Soulies, Skinheads and Skaters goes back to the source, charting the circle of street style from the forties to the nineties, and featuring nearly 200 authentic outfits in striking photographs with amazing detail that includes shoes, jewelry and accessories. A fascinating dimension is added as the authors place examples of street fashion alongside the high fashion creations they have influenced, illustrating how these fashions &#34;trickled up&#34; to inspire top designers including Calvin Klein, Versace, Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent. Accompanying the photographs are detailed descriptions and quotes from the wearers, giving their own highly individual views of their particular outfits. This is a flamboyant, one-of-a-kind survey of subcultural style that no one interested in fashion or design will want to miss.</p><p>This colorful exhibition catalog was produced to accompany a controversial streetstyle exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1994 and was written by that museum's curators of textiles and dress. The exhibit and this book attempt to codify British subcultural dress by dividing it into 50 categories spanning 50 years since World War II. Careful attention is given to the provenance of each garment and to overall look. Readers will be interested to see how styles that mainstream designers have adapted originated as statements of youthful rebellion. Unfortunately, the details are sometimes lost in the often small or dimly lit photographs, and British terminology may be confusing. Still, the text and captions are well written and amply detailed, and the book can be recommended as a fine example of creative design: layouts and type fonts were selected to typify and evoke each subculture. Overall, as a document of costume history and popular culture, this title belongs in every serious decorative arts collection.?Therese Duzinkiewicz Baker, Western Kentucky Univ. Libs., Bowling Green<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.The look of this volume is as eye-poppingly witty as the clothes that inspired it. Photographer Danny McGrath and book designer johnson banks. deserve as much credit as the authors in the bold, dynamic use of typefaces and other graphic elements to illustrate postwar fashion trends, from zoot suit to techno, mod to rave. De la Haye and Dingwall, curators of textiles and dress at London's Victoria and Albert Museum, propose the theory that fashion today originates not in the couture houses but on the streets, where ever-resourceful youths try to differentiate themselves from the adult masses, and their inventions then percolate up into the highest levels of fashion.

But now, this mesmerizing book of maps brings lands like<br>Neverland, Oz, and Aladdin's kingdom as close as kids' fingertips. Want to retrace Alice's steps through Wonderland? Start at the rabbit hole and follow the map past the Duchess's house to the croquet ground (just remember not to eat anything along the way!). With maps of six different lands to explore, each offering special points of interest, hidden objects to find, and dangers to avoid, young readers will be spending a lot of time in ONCE UPON A TIME &#x2014; and learning valuable map-reading skills along the way.</p><p>B. G. Hennessy came up with the idea for THE ONCE UPON A TIME MAP BOOK when her sons were bringing home school assignments involving map reading. "I've always liked the maps with the little pictures," she says. "So I decided to create a pictorial map book, a kind of travel guide to places kids would really want to visit."<br><br>Peter Joyce says, "As a child I was fascinated by little maps in stories that showed where everything happened and how it related. I enjoyed drawing my way around these famous fairy tales. They are very special &#x2014; such different imaginative worlds."Gr. 1-4. A 1999 book of foldout maps has been reissued in flat-page format. It's a charming concept: beautifully detailed watercolor and ink maps of Neverland, Wonderland, Oz, Aladdin's kingdom, Snow White's forest, and the Giant's realm with Jack are each on a double-page spread. There's a key and a series of instructions so that young readers can follow paths and byways, look for hidden features, and find a possible surprise or two. This also teaches rudiments of map reading and direction following in a friendly way, and it's sufficiently packed with diminutive images so that it can be pored over for a long time. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

With the support of an unusual boy named Sam, who helps Louis learn how to read and write, the swan has some rather unswanlike adventures and ultimately wins the love--and the freedom--of a beautiful swan named Serena.<p> For over 30 years, E.B. White's masterpiece has captured the fancy of countless readers. Now, with stunning new art by award-winning illustrator Fred Marcellino, the beloved story can be experienced anew. The sepia-colored drawings lend an old-fashioned charm to the story--it's almost as if, with their complementary dry wit and uniquely creative talents, White and Marcellino originally worked together. Marcellino received the Caldecott Honor for his illustrations in Charles Perrault's <i>Puss in Boots</i>.

But nothing seems to work. Then his father steals him a real brass trumpet. Is a musical instrument the key to winning Louis his love?</p></p><h2>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change</h2><p>THE 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE is recognized as one of the most influential audio-books ever recorded. In this seminal work, Stephen R. Covey presents a holistic, integrated, principle-centred approach for solving personal and professional problems. With penetrating insights and pointed anecdotes, Covey reveals a step-by-step pathway for living with fairness, integrity, honesty and human dignity - principles that give us the security to adapt to change, and the wisdom and power to take advantage of the opportunities that change creates. The 7 Habits have become so famous because they work. From Habit 1: Be Proactive and Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind, millions of people have worked their way through the 7 and found in them a key to transforming their lives. Translated into thirty-four languages THE 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE has been the key to the success of legions of business leaders and individuals the world over.</p><p>Anyone who thinks the audiocassette adaptation of Stephen Covey's bestseller, <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>, is a shortcut to reading the book has another thing coming. As a preview, the cassette is worth every one of its 90 minutes; as a substitute for the original, it will only leave you wishing for the rest. There's a reason <i>7 Habits</i> has sold more than 5 million copies and been translated into 32 languages. Serious work has obviously gone into it, and serious change can likely come out of it--but only with constant discipline and steadfast commitment. As the densely packed tape makes immediately clear, this is no quick fix for what's ailing us in our personal and professional lives.<p> The tape opens to the silky-smooth, overtrained voice of the female narrator, who's responsible for tying together audio clips from actual Covey seminars. Leaving aside the occasional attempts at promoting Covey and his institute, her script does a first-rate job of making sense of Covey's own intense, analogy-rich style of explaining his habits. There's nothing simple about his approach to becoming an effective person. The first three habits alone--which have to do with personal responsibility, leadership, and self-management--could take years to master. Yet the last four are unattainable, the narrator insists, if you can't acquire the personal security--the "inner core," says Covey--that presumably comes from a mastery of the foundation.</p><p> Throughout our lessons, Covey's presence is both learned and thoroughly appealing. He drops references to the likes of Socrates, T.S. Eliot, and Robert Frost with the aplomb of an English professor. And his knack for mixing everyday stories with abstract concepts manages to clarify difficult issues while respecting our intelligence. You could argue that the cassette is nothing more than a clever marketing tool for selling another few million copies of the book. But, even at that, it's worth the investment in time and concentration: in the end, we're moved to learn more about integrating all seven habits in our struggle to become better and, yes, more effective people. (Running time: 1.5 hours, one cassette) <i>--Ann Senechal</i></p><i>The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People</i> is a comprehensive program based on developing an awareness of how perceptions and assumptions hinder success---in business as well as presonal relationships. Here's an approach that will help broaden your way of thinking and lead to greater opportunities and effective problem solving. Be Pro-Active: Take the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen. Begin With an End in Mind: Start with a clear destination to understand where you are now, where you're going and what you value most. Put First Things First: Manage yourself. Organize and execute around priorities. Think Win/Win: See life as a cooperative, not a comprehensive arena where success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others. Seek First to Understand: Understand then be understood to build the skills of empathetic listening that inspires openness and trust. Synergize: Apply the principles of cooperative creativity and value differences. Renewal: Preserving and enhanving your greatest asset, yourself, by renewing the physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional dimensions of your nature. Stephen R. Covey is the most respected motivator in the business world today.

Original.</p><p>A.J. Baime, currently with <i>Playboy</i> magazine, was a senior editor at <i>Maxim</i>, covering food and beverage as well as a myriad of other beats. Baime has also written for <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Village Voice</i>, <i>Business 2.0</i>, <i>Popular Science</i>, <i>Time Out New York</i>, and others. He has a master's degree in literature from NYU, and an enduring and healthy romance with alcohol.Liquor brims with history, and Baime pours it neatly into this fittingly flask-sized handbook for barflies. Written in the irreverent tone of Maxim magazine, in which the former senior editor published early musings on the topic, this raucous manual reads like an ode to a lad's drinking buddies: Johnnie Walker, Seagram, Smirnoff and the swashbuckling, hollow-legged pirate, Captain Morgan (who never produced a drop, but drank himself to death). The stories scan the globe and cover four centuries-from Prohibition-era Kentucky to 17th-century Jamaica to the dairy farms of Ireland-introducing readers to the families and marketing wizards behind the world's best-selling labels. Despite its slim size, this compilation packs a wealth of trivia in intermittent tables and sidebars, such as "Tequila vs. Mezcal" (there are many differences in the distilling processes, but the latter is unregulated and sometimes has a worm in it), or "Rum Deconstructed" (which breaks down the various distillations of rums according to their fire power and flavor). Baime also recounts liquor-influenced history, like the "gin craze" that transformed 18th-century London "neighborhoods into ghettos, mothers into whores, and children and fathers into sloths and murders" or the CIA and a Bacardi CEO's collusion to "take out" Fidel Castro in the 1960s. Infused with Baime's own bleary-eyed accounts and flavored with favorite drink recipes, this spirited "guy's guide" will make a great stocking stuffer or groomsman gift. "If nothing else, you'll be the most enlightened person in the bar. And that's worth drinking to." <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Nightwalker</h2><p><br><br>One night, desperate for money to support her grandfather, Jessy Sparhawk places the bet that will change her life forever.

To defy the gods of Vegas, who always proclaimed that the house won.<br><br>Oh, yes, she was an idiot. Why in God's name had she taken the last of her savings to the craps table? She worked in Vegas, she had grown up out here. She'd seen the down-and-outers. She'd seen the poor, the pathetic, the alcoholics, the junkies, all trying for a big win when they knew the law of averages.<br><br>"Ten, baby, roll a hard ten" a man called from the end of the table. He wasn't one of the down-and-outers. He was a regular all over town. She had seen him over at the Big Easy, and he had a deep Southern accent, but one with a Texas twang. His name was Coot Calhoun. All right, so his real name probably wasn't <em>Coot, </em>but that was how he was known. Nice man. He'd inherited one of the biggest oil fields in Texas. She liked him. He had a wife named Minnie&#x2014;though Jessy was doubtful about <em>that </em>name, too&#x2014;who he genuinely loved, and he tipped well because he was generous, not because he was expecting any favors.<br><br>"I'm trying, Coot, I'm trying," she assured him, praying for a hard ten not for Coot's sake but for Tim's.<br><br>She was here, gambling at the Vegas Sun, because she wasn't allowed to gamble in the casino where she worked, which usually didn't bother her, since she wasn't a gambler. The Sun was owned by a billionaire who had been in the casino trade a long time. Her own Big Easy was owned by Emil Landon. A rich man, yes. A very rich man. But he hadn't been at the casino game long. Even though she wasn't a gambler, she knew the games. She'd been a dealer, a hostess, a waitress, a bartender, a singer, a dancer&#x2014;even an acrobat for a brief period of time. She knew Vegas in and out, backward and forward, and she had learned long, long ago, not to gamble, because the house always won.<br><br>"Baby, baby, baby, <em>bee-you-ti-ful </em>baby, do it. Hard ten," another man called. He was young. Drunk. Probably had too much money on the board, and definitely had too much alcohol in his system.<br><br>She was aware of so many people watching her. It had been kind of fun at first, but now she felt the tension. Even Darrell Frye, one of the Sun's pit bosses, was watching her with a measuring stare, as if afraid she was on one of those long rolls that totally outweighed the odds.<br><br>"Ten, ten, ten," a nearby woman repeated fervently. She was haggard looking, thin, and her dress had been stylish twenty years ago, back when she had been pretty. Now her features bore the weight of time, but she offered Jessy a smile, and Jessy smiled back.<br><br>"Get on with it," someone else insisted. "Just roll."<br><br>She did. To her horror, the dice bounced off the table.<br><br>"Hey, it's all right, just a game," said a deep, smooth, masculine voice.<br><br>She looked up. The man who had spoken was several people away to her left, and she had noticed him earlier. He was the kind of man it was hard not to notice. He wasn't typically handsome, and certainly not a pretty boy, but he had what she could only call presence. Tall, with broad shoulders, he managed to be simultaneously casual and elegant, and rugged on top of that.<br><br>She flashed him a smile. He wasn't drunk; he had been sipping the same drink since she had started watching the table. She was five-ten and wearing heels, but he towered over her by several inches. His eyes were so dark that to call them brown would be an injustice. His hair, too, was almost ebony, and the striking cut of his cheekbones made her think there had to be Native American blood in his background, and maybe not far back. He was simply striking, dressed in a white pin-striped shirt open at the neck, a nicely fitted jacket and black jeans. He hadn't been risking big money, but he had played as if he knew something about the game, and he'd been playing the same money since she first noticed him. And he seemed to be watching for more than just the roll of the dice.<br><br>He lifted his glass to her and looked over at the dealer as he tossed out two hundred-dollar chips. "Hard ten for me and for the roller," he said.<br><br>"You don't need to&#x2014;" she began.<br><br>"Jessy, just roll, sweetie," Coot called to her, then turned to the croupier as he picked up two chips himself. "My money is on the little lady. Throw this on the hard ten, one for me, one for her, please."<br><br>His hundreds went down.<br><br>More chips were thrown down on the hard ten, plenty of them for her, and she knew that she was blushing. "Thanks," she murmured, looking at the man who had started it all. The pressure was really on now. A so-called "hard" bet paid really well.<br><br>But there was a lot of money to be lost if she failed.<br><br>Her handsome benefactor said, "Don't worry. It's going to be a hard ten. And if it's not, it's all right. I never put down what I can't afford to lose."<br><br>She wished she could say the same thing. But at this point, she was desperate. If she didn't come up with the money, she couldn't pay to keep Timothy in the home. She could see Mr. Hoskins' face now, as he calmly told her, "I'm sorry, Miss Sparhawk, but there's nothing we can do. I've been as patient as I can, but if I don't have that three thousand dollars by tomorrow morning, you'll have to find another facility."<br><br>She hated Hoskins. He was a thin-lipped, nose-in-the-air jerk, but he only ran the Hawthorne Home; he wasn't the one who spent time with Tim. And Tim loved Jimmy Britin, the orderly, and Liz Freeze, his nurse. And Dr. Joe, who was a wonderful man, who worked at the home in order to be able to afford to donate his time at several local shelters.<br><br>A hard ten. If she rolled a hard ten, two fives, she made not just her own hundred-dollar bet, but...ten times that hundred. Plenty of money to keep Timothy where he needed to be.<br><br>She swallowed hard and rolled the dice.<br><br>"Hard ten, hard ten!" It became a chant.<br><br>She had never seen dice roll for so long on a craps table. A four and a three... and groans went around the table, because a seven meant that she would crap out. But the dice were still rolling....<br><br>A five and a three.<br><br>A five and a two.<br><br>A five and...<br><br>A five. A hard ten.<br><br>The screaming and shouting was deafening. Hands clapping, high fives all around. She wasn't sure who picked her up and swung her around, but she didn't protest that any more than she protested the hugs and backslaps that came her way, or even Coot's enthusiastic kiss on her cheek. She was simply too stunned.<br><br>The one man who didn't grab her or go insane was the tall, dark-haired stranger. He just watched her, pleased, and yet somehow grave.<br><br>Jessy couldn't believe the number of chips coming her way.<br><br>"I'm cashing in," she told the dealer.<br><br>He gave her an odd look. "You're still rolling," he reminded her. "If you leave, these folks will lynch me. Don't pass the roll. Go until you crap out."<br><br>She glanced to the side, looking for the dark-haired stranger.<br><br>He was gone; of course. He wasn't rolling. Still, she missed him. And she had the oddest feeling that things weren't going to go right, now that he was gone. And she was right, because it wasn't long until she crapped out. Still, as she collected her chips, which were still worth far more than the three thousand dollars she needed, everyone regaled her as if she were a celebrity. She thanked them, then turned, eager to escape as quickly as possible.<br><br>That was when the huge man plowed into her.<br><br>Huge. Bodyguard huge. He was bald and built like a wall of solid rock. His eyes were hazel and streaked with red.<br><br>"Hey!" Coot yelled indignantly.<br><br>It didn't stop the man, who hit her so hard that he knocked her flat onto the craps table, then fell on top of her.<br><br>She was pinned, and when she tried to budge his weight, she couldn't. She started to ask the onlookers for assistance, but her words were cut short by someone's shrill, hysterical scream.<br><br>And then she felt the blood trickling down on her as she struggled under the man's weight.<br><br>His <em>dead </em>weight...<br><br>His glazed and frozen eyes stared at her, and then his mouth moved.<br><br>He spoke one word.<br><br>"Indigo."<br><br>And then his lips stopped moving and something, some light, went out in his eyes.<br><br>She tried to twist out from beneath him, and that was when she saw the knife sticking out of his back, saw the blood, and began to scream herself.<br><br>Dillon Wolf heard the screams just seconds after he had stepped into the special "high-roller" section of the casino. He spun around, returning at a breakneck speed, and arrived back at the craps table just as casino security descended on it. He saw the beautiful redhead he'd staked earlier, desperately trying to push the weight of the huge man off her, and he saw the man's face almost as quickly.<br><br>Tanner Green. Hell.<br><br>He'd spent most of the night keeping track of who was coming and going, trying to get a handle on who was frequenting the new casino, and the last damn thing he'd imagined was Green turning up dead. The man was a pro. <em>Had been </em>a pro. Not only that, before rejoining the world,he'd worked as a mercenary; there was no way in hell he should have been taken by surprise by anyone. But a knife in the back? That pretty much screamed <em>surprise.</em><br><br>The fact that the police would want the body left <em>in situ </em>didn't prevent him from diving in to help the redhead free herself as quickly as possible.<br><br>"Hey, hey!" one of the security officers said, hurrying forward, but he ignored the man.<br><br>"Thank you," the redhead whispered as he shifted her free of the corpse and she managed to get back on her feet. For a moment, though, her eyes were on his. Huge. A deep, radiant blue, like a cloudless sky. Those eyes had first met his just a few minutes earlier as she rolled the dice. Now he also noticed that she smelled good, not to mention that she <em>felt </em>good against him.<br><br>As soon as he saw that she was steady, he delved into his pocket for his ID, presenting it to the security officer.<br><br>"Dillon Wolf, licensed P.I.," he said. "Have the police been called?"<br><br>"The 911 has gone in, they'll be here momentarily," the security officer said. Two of the men accompanying him had already begun to form an invisible ring around the craps table; two more were hurrying over to bar the door.<br><br>"Oh God, I have to get out of here. I have to get out of here!" a woman cried hysterically.<br><br>"Calm down," Dillon said, his voice taking on a deep authoritative pitch. He had long ago learned that people didn't obey high voices in an emergency; they only became more hysterical.<br><br>The redhead was silent, but he saw that she was shivering. Something in her eyes told him that she knew she was going to be there for a long time, the center of a murder investigation. She was stunning, absolutely stunning, and something about her intrigued him. Las Vegas was full of gorgeous women, of course&#x2014;showgirls, waitresses, actresses, singers&#x2014;but she seemed different somehow.<br><br>When he'd first noticed her, those eyes of hers had been... haunted. Not as if she was afraid of losing a dream, certainly not as if she was afraid of simply losing...money, but as if she was terrified of losing something far more precious. As if the roll of the dice could cost her her very soul.<br><br>He gave himself a mental shake. He had other things to think about here. Not only was there a dead man lying on the craps table, but that dead man was Tanner Green.<br><br>A man came striding onto the scene. A big guy with an attitude. Jerry Cheever, Las Vegas homicide. Dillon was pretty sure that Cheever resented him, but Cheever knew the lay of the land. He might despise Dillon on every level, but he'd been told by his bosses that Dillon was to be granted free rein. Cheever liked his paycheck and his position, so he obeyed, but he also liked to take credit for things that went well, and he knew Dillon had a talent for seeing an investigation through, and he wasn't above taking advantage of that fact.<br><br>Especially because he simply wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.<br><br>"No one move!" Cheever bellowed. "And I mean <em>no one!"</em><br><br>He took note of the blood seeping into the green felt tabletop and soaking the multicolored chips.<br><br>"Wolf," he said curtly, acknowledging Dillon's presence. His eyes settled on the redhead as he asked Dillon, "What happened?"<br><br>"I wasn't here. I ran over when I heard the screaming," Dillon said.<br><br>Jerry Cheever turned to the redhead.<br><br>"What happened?" he demanded curtly.<br><br>"I was leaving the table. This man came over and... and fell on me," she said.<br><br>"Do you know him?" Cheever demanded.<br><br>"I've never seen him before," she said.<br><br>"You're sure?" Cheever pressed.<br><br>"Absolutely sure," she said with confidence. She was still trembling slightly. Not surprising, Dillon thought, given that she was wearing the dead man's blood.<br><br>"Are you hurt?" he asked her quietly.<br><br>She shook her head.<br><br>Cheever took in the corpse. "Christ! It's Tanner Green." He glared at Dillon again. "Aren't you two working for&#x2014;"<br><br>"Yes," Dillon said curtly.<br><br>"But you weren't together?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Lieutenant Cheever, the M.E. is here," a newly arrived police officer informed him.<br><br>"Give him room. No one gets out those doors, do you hear?" Cheever said.<br><br>A murmur arose from the crowd, but Cheever wasn't disturbed."Give your payouts, close your tables," he commanded the casino employees, then turned to his fellow officers. "I want men posted at all the doors. No one leaves here without presenting ID and a valid local address, and not until they've been questioned. Are we understood?"<br><br></p><h2>The Little Book of Big Savings: 351 Practical Ways to Save Money Now</h2><p><b>Be richer by this time tomorrow</b><br><br>Every month you spend money in twelve major categories.

You Have More Money Than You Thought You Had!<br><br></b>Some of my most exciting moments are when I find unexpected &#x201c;surprise&#x201d; money. You know the kind. While cleaning out the pockets before you throw your jeans in the washing machine, you pull out a five dollar bill you forgot you had. Or when you&#x2019;re walking down the street and you discover a dollar bill just lying there. It&#x2019;s the best feeling, isn&#x2019;t it?<br><br>Well, what if I were to tell you that you have surprise money all around you. In every room of your house or apartment. Money just sitting there, waiting for you to notice it. Yes, you read that right! You just have to know where and how to look. Extra cash. Even if you&#x2019;ve lost your job. Even if you are so far in debt that you see everything in red. Even if your family is eating you out of house and home.<br><br>How do I know you can find money right under your nose? Because when my husband, Bob, and I were first married, we were $40,000 in consumer debt&#x2014;and yet everywhere I looked, I realized that I could find money. I felt so empowered! And within two and a half years, living on just my husband&#x2019;s military salary, we used all that surprise money to pay off our debts.<br><br>Fifteen years and seven children later, we were able to pay cash for our cars (we even gave away three cars!), buy and nicely furnish two five-bedroom houses (moving from one to the other), take wonderful vacations, dress our family in style, build a nest egg for retirement, become debt free, and send three children (so far) to college without college loans. And the best part? My family and I have been able to share our money (more than $100,000) with people and causes that desperately need help. If a military husband, a stay-at-home mom, and seven kids can do it, believe me, so can you!<br><br>I&#x2019;m passionate about saving money, and I&#x2019;m really good at it (if I do say so!). I can find the smartest and least expensive way to do or have just about anything. And I&#x2019;m excited about being able to share all my tips with you so that you can save money too.<br><i><br>Yeah, right, </i>I can hear you thinking. <i>I get it. My surprise money is me reusing aluminum foil over and over. </i>Um, no. One time I had a woman approach me, shaking her head. She said, &#x201c;Ellie, are you going to tell me I have to wash out and reuse plastic baggies?&#x201d; I&#x2019;ll tell you what I told her. &#x201c;No! No! No! Unless...you really want to.&#x201d; Hello? You don&#x2019;t have to live like an obsessive Scrooge in order to save money! Why do we put all these downers on saving money? Sometimes pinching pennies can get old.<br>Real old. Way old. Big-time old. Stinkin&#x2019; old. Big, fat, double-dog-ugly old.<br><br>Which brings me to an important point: too many people think that to save money, you have to live like a monk, taking a vow of poverty, or you have to do extreme, crazy things. Seriously. I have better ways to spend my time! And I assume you do too. Let me put your mind at ease.<br><br>Here is a list of things I am <i>not </i>going to suggest you do in order to save money:<br>� Ask your grandmother to start saving foil in little balls for you.<br>� To save water, keep your fish in the toilet bowl and train it to cling to the sides at the first sound of rushing water.<br>� When at a pizza shop, and the couple next to you leaves half a pizza untouched and uneaten, ask the waitress for a carry-out box.<br>� When you are driving down the road, pull over your Mercedes wannabe to pick up a piece of fruit you see lying by the side of the road.<br>� Search the Internet for creative ways to use those bits of soap that are too little to use but too big to throw away.<br>� Recycle the cotton balls that you take from the top of your vitamin bottles.<br>� When your friend asks you to meet her for lunch, try to talk her into a restaurant she doesn&#x2019;t like because it offers &#x201c;buy one/get one free&#x201d; and you can get the free lunch.<br>� Wear the same clothes three days in a row in order to &#x201c;get your money&#x2019;s worth&#x201d; out of the wash.<br>� Wash and reuse plastic Ziploc bags.<br><br>I&#x2019;m proud of the ways my family and I&#x2014;and you can!&#x2014;save money. In fact, in my book <i>Living Rich for Less </i>(the companion to this book), I tell you not only how to save more than $30,000 a year by using my Cha-Ching Factor&#x2122; tips, I give you great, practical, and easy-to implement financial principles to live a rich lifestyle. Now, does that sound like living a life filled with trained fish and aluminum foil balls?<br><br>WHAT YOU MAKE AND WHAT YOU (DON&#x2019;T) SAVE<br><br>Did you know that the average American family makes $48,000 per year, and an amazing 85 percent of the population makes $100,000 or less? Most of the average folks are living paycheck to paycheck. And in many families, ATM withdrawals account for as much as 20 percent of the month&#x2019;s spending, but they cannot account for a majority of those dollars! They save -0.5 percent. That means most Americans are spending more than they are making. If you&#x2019;re like the average person, you don&#x2019;t pay attention<br>to how much you&#x2019;re spending. Your spending plan is actually, well, not a plan at all. Take a look at the typical family, whom I&#x2019;ll call the Bensons. They are married with children&#x2014;two, to be exact.<br><br>� They live in a modest three-bedroom, two bath home with a yard and a lazy dog.<br>� They don&#x2019;t have a household budget.<br>� They have an annual income of $48,000.<br>� They owe about $8,500 in credit card debt.<br>� They have two car payments.<br>� They have a thirty-year mortgage.<br>� Their savings account has less than $500 in it.<br>� They have no long-term retirement account.<br>� They love their kids and want them to go to college.<br>� They are wondering, <i>Where did all the dough go?<br></i><br>But the really amazing thing about the Bensons is where they <i>think </i>they will be one day. The Bensons believe that one day they are going to earn more money through raises or a better job. They hope they will receive an inheritance or a financial windfall. They figure that someday they will no longer have student loan payments and that childcare costs will go away when the kids are in school&#x2014; thus cutting down on their monthly expenses. Then they&#x2019;ll finally have some breathing room. They also believe:<br><br>� One day they&#x2019;ll have their credit cards paid off.<br>� One day they&#x2019;ll have a nice savings account.<br>� One day they&#x2019;ll get a couple of IRAs.<br>� One day they will be able to send their kids to college and still have a retirement fund for their golden years.<br><br>But they have no plan! They think it will &#x201c;just work out.&#x201d; One day, that is. One fine day. Hello? The hard fact about the Bensons is that if they continue the way they are now, with no real plan, they will:<br><br>� Pay five times as much on their house as it is worth (possibly more with the drop in real<br>estate prices and the economy).<br>� Increase their credit card debt.<br>� Never get out of consumer debt.<br>� Get a second mortgage on their home to pay for their kids&#x2019; college expenses.<br>� Never acquire enough savings to retire comfortably.<br>� Always have car payments.<br>� Never realize their financial goals.<br><br>So much for living the American dream, right? You may identify with the Bensons&#x2014;a little too much! Or maybe you don&#x2019;t quite fit their profile&#x2014;maybe you&#x2019;re not married, or married without children, or don&#x2019;t own a house&#x2014;but you still feel their pain a little too closely. Now may be a good time to take a good, hard, honest look at your spending habits. Ask yourself these questions&#x2014; and be honest!<br>� Do my family and I currently live by a clear cut, focused spending plan?<br>� Do I consistently stick to that plan?<br>� Do I buy something only because I <i>really </i>need it (not just because I want it)?<br>� Do I give a portion of my income to my church or a charitable cause?<br>� Do I have a total consumer debt load of less than 10 percent of my annual income? (For example, if you earn $50,000 per year, you have a non-mortgage debt load of $5,000 or less.)<br>� Do I save at least 10 percent of my income?<br>� Do I have a savings account with at least two months&#x2019; worth of income in it?<br>� Do I own a retirement account or mutual fund of any kind?<br>� Do I buy something because a commercial convinces me to buy it?<br><br>As you answer those questions, you may feel, well, ill. It can be a rude awakening when someone (me!) reminds you of your situation and where you should be. That&#x2019;s okay. The good news is that whatever your marital, housing, or debt situation, you can do something positive. You can change your financial future. The key is to really pay attention to how you spend your money each month. Every month you spend your hard-earned cash on the following things: mortgage/rent and utilities, transportation, food (including dining out), clothing/dry cleaning/other shopping, recreation/entertainment, vacation, gifts, medical/dental/insurance, big ticket items (furniture/appliances), education, pets, credit cards, savings (hopefully!), charitable giving, and other incidentals I didn&#x2019;t include in this list. And every month, if you&#x2019;re like the Bensons, you make the payments without much thought or planning.<br><br>By picking up this book (along with my other book, <i>Living Rich for Less</i>), you&#x2019;ve taken the first real steps to changing your future, to taking back control of where <i>your </i>money goes every month. You&#x2019;re going to be amazed by how much surprise money you&#x2019;re about to find. In <i>Living Rich for Less </i>I go into detail about what I call a life-changing financial principle, the 10/10/80 Rule&#x2122;. With this principle you give away 10 percent of your income, save 10 percent, and spend the remaining 80 percent wisely. I know people are skeptical when I tell them they need to give and save first, but when you spend the 80 percent wisely, you will more than make up for it. Trust me, I&#x2019;ve been there, done that. I know it&#x2019;s possible&#x2014;and I can show you how to find enough money to live rich and share your wealth. In this book I&#x2019;m going to show you exactly how to save money and spend that 80 percent wisely, so that every month you don&#x2019;t dread those checkbook-balancing-bill-paying-moments. Can you imagine? Being thrilled and excited to balance your checkbook and see how much extra money is there? In each of the following chapters I offer a big tip that will take about twelve minutes a week, but those minutes can pay big dividends of $1,200 a month&#x2014;or more! Then I provide other great, practical tips (more than two hundred total!) that you can put into practice right away to start watching your savings grow. You&#x2019;ll be amazed by how much extra money you can have at the end of each month. Ready to figure out your spending plan and put it into action?

Three women of varying ages and backgrounds with little else in common but for one thing: Someone has sent them each a note informing them that they will be killed. A cruel joke? A hoax? The police don&#39;t seem to think so. Now, with no clear suspect and amid the growing threat of violence, the victims become the accused as authorities dig into their backgrounds for clues as to why they might have attracted the unrelenting attention of a killer. As Zoe, Jenny, and Nadia find themselves being victimized twiceover, once by the faceless stalker and again by the police, each must ultimately face the question of which is stronger: the instinct to survive, or the desire to destroy?</p><p><i>"When she laughs, she makes a pealing sound, like a doorbell. If I told her I loved her, she would laugh at me like that. She would think I was not serious. That is what women do. They turn what is serious and big into a small thing, a joke. Love is not a joke. It is a matter of life and death. One day, soon, she will understand that."</i><p> Zoe, a pretty blond schoolteacher. Jenny, a former hand model turned model wife and mother. Nadia, an irrepressible free spirit who entertains at children's parties. Three women living in different parts of London, grappling with different problems, sheltering different dreams--their lives and narratives linked only by the singular madness of a sadistic stalker. As they move slowly through the sweltering heat of summer, someone is sending these women letters that let each know she is being watched, studied, and loved from afar--even unto death.</p><p> <i>Beneath the Skin</i> is a spooky, highly effective psychological thriller. Initially, the women refuse, as do the police, to take the threats seriously--they are happy, they are inviolable; surely these letters are the work of a harmless crank. But the novel watches Zoe, Nadia, and Jenny move from blithely insouciant denial, to frustration, to creeping terror, and finally to the stark realization that neither they nor anyone else will prevent this killer from destroying them. French skillfully evokes the insidiousness with which the letters invade the women's lives, straining and shattering relationships, pushing each toward fearful insanity. Perhaps the novel's greatest appeal lies in its mordant irony: not only do the stalker's threats push and fester "beneath the skin," but they also draw out the flaws and terrors that are already there. French sketches the women's weaknesses and fears with merciless accuracy, stripping them naked long before the killer arrives to finish what his letters have begun.</p><p> The author's talent for psychological portraiture is, in fact, so great as to undermine, however slightly, the novel itself. We become so aware of the women, of their responses, of their needs, that the actual murders arrive as an almost superfluous intrusion. We respect the demands of the genre--a thriller needs thrills, after all--but wistfully regret the loss of the victims, even as we guiltily acknowledge our own voyeuristic culpability in their disintegration. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>&#34; NICCI FRENCH is the author of the bestseller Killing Me Softly, as well as two earlier books, The Memory Game and The Safe House, which were published in England to wide acclaim.&#34;</p><h2>A Life Like Other People&#39;s</h2><p>This moving, affectionate, witty and often very funny memoir by one of Britain&#39;s best loved writers tells of his parents&#39; marriage and his own childhood in 1940s Leeds. It is filled with wry and poignant vignettes of Christmases with Grandma Peel and the lives and loves of his unforgettable aunties Kathleen and Myra. Tragically, it also recounts his mother&#39;s slow descent into depression and dementia as a long-buried family secret is finally brought to light.</p><p>Alan Bennett has been one of our leading dramatists since the success of Beyond the Fringe in the 1960s.

His collection of prose, Untold Stories, won the PEN/Ackerley Prize for autobiography, 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a wood, the canal, the river, and above the river the railway and the road. It&#x2019;s the first proper country that you get to as you come north out of Leeds, and going home on the train I pass the place quite often. Only these days I look. I&#x2019;ve been passing the place for years without looking because I didn&#x2019;t know it was a place; that anything had happened there to make it a place, let alone a place that had something to do with me. Below the wood the water is deep and dark and sometimes there&#x2019;s a boy fishing or a couple walking a dog. I suppose it&#x2019;s a beauty spot now. It probably was then.&nbsp;&#x2018;Has there been any other mental illness in your family?&#x2019; Mr Parr&#x2019;s pen hovers over the Yes/No box on the form and my father, who is letting me answer the questions, looks down at his trilby and says nothing.&#x2018;No,&#x2019; I say confidently, and Dad turns the trilby in his hands.&#x2018;Anyway,&#x2019; says Mr Parr kindly but with what the three of us know is more tact than truth, &#x2018;depression isn&#x2019;t really mental illness. I see it all the time.&#x2019;Mr Parr sees it all the time because he is the Mental Health Welfare Officer for the Craven district, and late this September evening in 1966 Dad and I are sitting in his bare linoleum-floored office above Settle police station while he takes a history of my mother.&#x2018;So there&#x2019;s never been anything like this before?&#x2019;&#x2018;No,&#x2019; I say, and without doubt or hesitation. After all, I&#x2019;m the educated one in the family. I&#x2019;ve been to Oxford. If there had been &#x2018;anything like this&#x2019; I should have known about it. &#x2018;No, there&#x2019;s never been anything like this.&#x2019;&#x2018;Well,&#x2019; Dad says, and the information is meant for me as much as for Mr Parr, &#x2018;she did have something once. Just before we were married.&#x2019; And he looks at me apologetically. &#x2018;Only it was nerves more. It wasn&#x2019;t like this.&#x2019;The &#x2018;this&#x2019; that it wasn&#x2019;t like was a change in my mother&#x2019;s personality that had come about with startling suddenness. Over a matter of weeks she had lost all her fun and vitality, turning fretful and apprehensive and inaccessible to reason or reassurance. As the days passed the mood deepened, bringing with it fantasy and delusion; the house was watched, my father made to speak in a whisper because there was someone on the landing, and the lavatory (always central to Mam&#x2019;s scheme of things) was being monitored every time it was flushed. She started to sleep with her handbag under her pillow as if she were in a strange and dangerous hotel, and finally one night she fled the house in her nightgown, and Dad found her wandering in the street, whence she could only be fetched back into the house after some resistance.Occurring in Leeds, where they had always lived, conduct like this might just have got by unnoticed, but the onset of the depression coincided with my parents&#x2019; retirement to a village in the Dales, a place so small and close-knit that such bizarre behaviour could not be hidden. Indeed it was partly the knowledge that they were about to leave the relative anonymity of the city for a small community where &#x2018;folks knew all your business&#x2019; and that she would henceforth be socially much more visible than she was used to (&#x2018;I&#x2019;m the centrepiece here&#x2019;) that might have brought on the depression in the first place. Or so Mr Parr is saying.My parents had always wanted to be in the country and have a garden. Living in Leeds all his life Dad looked back on the childhood holidays he had spent holidays on a farm at Bielby in the East Riding as a lost paradise. The village they were moving to was very pretty, too pretty for Mam in her depressed mood: &#x2018;You&#x2019;ll see,&#x2019; she said, &#x2018;we&#x2019;ll be inundated with folk visiting.&#x2019;The cottage faced onto the village street but had a long garden at the back, and it seemed like the place they had always dreamed of. This was in 1966. A few years later I wrote a television play, Sunset Across the Bay, in which a retired couple not unlike my parents leave Leeds to go and live in Morecambe. As the coach hits the M62, bearing them away to a new life, the wife calls out, &#x2018;Bye bye, mucky Leeds!&#x2019; And so it had seemed. Now Dad was being told that it was this longed-for escape that had brought down this crushing visitation on his wife. Not surprisingly he would not believe it.In their last weeks in Leeds Dad had put Mam&#x2019;s low spirits down to the stress of the impending upheaval. Once the move had been accomplished, though, the depression persisted so now he fell back on the state of the house, blaming its bare unfurnished rooms, still with all the decorating to be done.&#x2018;Your Mam&#x2019;ll be better when we&#x2019;ve got the place straight,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;She can&#x2019;t do with it being all upset.&#x2019; So, while she sat fearfully on a hard chair in the passage, he got down to the decorating.My brother, who had come up from Bristol to help with the move, also thought the state of the house was to blame, fastening particularly on an item that seemed to be top of her list of complaints, the absence of stair-carpet. I think I knew then that stair-carpet was only the beginning of it, and indeed when my brother galvanised a local firm into supplying and fitting the carpet in a couple of days Mam seemed scarcely to notice, the clouds did not lift, and in due course my brother went back to Bristol and I to London.Over the next ten years this came to be the pattern. The onset of a bout of depression would fetch us home for a while, but when no immediate recovery was forthcoming we would take ourselves off again while Dad was left to cope. Or to care, as the phrase is nowadays. Dad was the carer. We cared, of course, but we still had lives to lead: Dad was retired &#x2013; he had all the time in the world to care.&nbsp;&#x2018;The doctor has put her on tablets,&#x2019; Dad said over the phone, &#x2018;only they don&#x2019;t seem to be doing the trick.&#x2019; Tablets seldom did, even when one saw what was coming and caught it early. The onset of depression would find her sitting on unaccustomed chairs &#x2013; the cork stool in the bathroom, the hard chair in the hall that was just there for ornament and where no one ever sat, its only occupant the occasional umbrella. She would perch in the passage, dumb with misery and apprehension, motioning me not to go into the empty living room because there was someone there.&#x2018;You won&#x2019;t tell anybody?&#x2019; she whispered.&#x2018;Tell anybody what?&#x2019;&#x2018;Tell them what I&#x2019;ve done.&#x2019;&#x2018;You haven&#x2019;t done anything.&#x2019;&#x2018;But you won&#x2019;t tell them?&#x2019;&#x2018;Mam!&#x2019; I said, exasperated, but she put her hand to my mouth, pointed at the living-room door and then wrote TALKING in wavering letters on a pad, mutely shaking her head.As time went on these futile discussions would become less intimate (less caring even), the topography quite spread out, with the parties not even in adjoining rooms. Dad would be sitting by the living-room fire while Mam hovered tearfully in the doorway of the pantry, the kitchen in between empty.&#x2018;Come in the pantry, Dad,&#x2019; she&#x2019;d call.&#x2018;What for? What do I want in the pantry?&#x2019;&#x2018;They can see you.&#x2019;&#x2018;How can they see me? There&#x2019;s nobody here.&#x2019;&#x2018;There is, only you don&#x2019;t know. Come in here.&#x2019;It didn&#x2019;t take much of this before Dad lapsed into a weary silence.&#x2018;Oh, whish&#x2019;t,&#x2019; he&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;be quiet.&#x2019;A play could begin like this, I used to think &#x2013; with a man on stage, sporadically angry with a woman off stage, his bursts of baffled invective gradually subsiding into an obstinate silence. Resistant to the off-stage entreaties, he continues to ignore her until his persistent refusal to respond gradually tempts the woman into view.Or set in the kitchen, the empty room between them, no one on stage at all, just the voices off. And what happens when they do come on stage? Violence, probably.It was all so banal. Missionary for her sunless world, my mother was concerned to convince us in the face of all vehement denial that sooner or later she would be taken away. And of course she was right.Her other fears ... of being spied on, listened to, shamed and detected ... were ordinary stuff too. This was not the territory of grand delusion, her fears not decked out in the showy accoutrements of fashionable neurosis. None of Freud&#x2019;s patients hovered at pantry doors; Freud&#x2019;s selected patients, I always felt, the ordinary not getting past, or even to, the first consultation because too dull, the final disillusion to have fled across the border into unreason only to find you are as mundane mad as you ever were sane.Certainly in all her excursions into unreality Mam remained the shy, unassuming woman she had always been, none of her fantasies extravagant, her claims, however irrational they might be, always modest. She might be ill, disturbed, mad even, but she still knew her place.It may be objected that madness did not come into it; that, as Mr Parr had said, this was depression and a very different thing. But though we clung to this assurance, it was hard not to think these delusions mad and the tenacity with which she held to them, defended them, insisted on them the very essence of unreason. While it was perhaps na�ve of us to expect her to recognise she was ill, or that standing stock still on the landing by the hour together was not normal behaviour, it was this determination t...</p><h2>Negotiating Commercial Real Estate Leases</h2><p>While many books offer sample forms and advice about drafting clauses for retail, office, and industrial leases, few examine the essential business issues underlying each clause of the lease from both sides of the negotiating table &#x2014; tenant and landlord alike. <p>Whether you are a business owner about to sign a lease, a real estate professional determined to draft the ideal transaction for your client, or a landlord looking to protect profits and property simultaneously, Negotiating Commercial Real Estate Leases can help you understand </p><p><br>*The obvious and not-so-obvious differences between &#x201c;standard&#x201d; landlord and tenant leases. <br>*Specific negotiating strategies for retail/shopping center, office and industrial leases. <br>*The critical economic and legal issues at stake in each clause of the lease. <br>*Which points are most easily negotiated under what situations and which points aren&#x2019;t worth the time spent arguing. <br>*What alternative clauses and solutions can be offered to create a deal that works for both parties. </p><p>As the basics of term, rent, premises, assignment, maintenance, insurance, default, taxes, alterations, and more are covered, author Martin Zankel uses wit and wisdom to break down confusing legalisms and offer basic negotiating strategies for each situation. </p><p>The book also includes two appendixes that provide examples of a tenant-oriented lease and a landlord-oriented lease.</p></p><p></p><h2>When Photography Really Works</h2><p>Every day and all over the world, millions of people take countless photographs.

Surviving pogroms and politburos, he has solved crimes, mostly in spite of the powers that be that rule his world. &nbsp;In <i>People Who Walk in Darkness, </i>Rostnikov travels to Siberia to investigate a murder at a diamond mine, where he discovers an old secret...and an even older personal problem.&nbsp;His compatriots head to Kiev on a trail of smuggled diamonds and kidnapped guest workers...and what they discover leads them to a vast conspiracy that not only has international repercussions but threatens them on a very personal level.<br><i></i><i></i>&nbsp;<i>People Who Walk in Darkness</i> is a fast-paced novel of modern Russia told by one of mystery&#x2019;s finest storytellers.</p><p>Stuart M. Kaminsky&nbsp;was the author of more than 60 novels and&nbsp;an Edgar Award winner who&nbsp;was given the coveted Grand Master Award by the Mystery Writers of America.&nbsp;Kaminsky also created the critically acclaimed Inspector Rostinkov and Toby Peters mystery series.&nbsp; He passed away in the fall of 2009.Chapter One <p></p>Luc O&#x2019;Neil was lost. <p></p>He wasn&#x2019;t particularly worried. <p></p>His cell phone wouldn&#x2019;t work down in the labyrinth nine hundred feet below the frozen layer of earth, but the homing device required of everyone entering the mine was glowing bright green. The pipe, the vein of rock that contained the diamonds, was a reasonably rich one. Nothing exceptional but productive, small, brown gems that would go mainly into industrial tools and the vast stockpile of the Russian diamond monopoly Alorosa, which in turn sold its holdings to DeBeers. <p></p>Twenty percent of all diamonds mined worldwide were from Russia and all of the mines, Luc knew, were located in Siberia. If they dared, which they would not do because there would be no profit in it, Alorosa could challenge DeBeers and flood the market with relatively inexpensive diamonds of all quality levels. It was a standing, unspoken suicidal threat, a doomsday scenario for the diamond market. The price paid by <p></p>the world for diamonds allowed Russia a preferred seat at the table. <p></p>The value of diamonds, as Luc knew, was not dependent on their rarity, but on the ability of the diamond cartel to control their flow and price. Luc was well aware that diamonds are nothing but pieces of compressed carbon found not only in Siberia but in Botswana, Australia, South Africa, and, to a smaller degree, all over the planet. <p></p>But production was down in this mine. Or at least that was what Luc had been told. His job was to find out if the mine was so tapped out that it would not pay to keep it operating. <p></p>Luc was a geologist with a good underground sense of direction. But if that failed him, he could always follow the dull yellow lights that glowed indifferently every fifty yards or so on the jagged walls of the tunnel. <p></p>He was contracted with and well paid by the Canadian company that owned a piece of this operation. And so, screw &#x2019;em. He had a job to do, plain and simple. He would get it done and get out of here, e-mail his report to London, let DeBeers deal with it, and get the hell back to Toronto. Luc had missed his son&#x2019;s birthday only two months ago, when he was in Australia. Collette had not bothered to reproach him. What was the point? Let the boy know what kind of father he had, she had said. Well, she was right. <p></p>Luc scanned the walls for signs. He had been doing this for a decade. He didn&#x2019;t have to think about what he was looking for. It either felt right or it didn&#x2019;t. The diamond sense was a part of him. He was a human detector. <p></p>Dobson had told Luc he had been selected because he had more experience in this sort of thing. What sort of thing? Going into underground diamond mines, finding out why production was down, and determining if the mines were finally tapped out? <p></p>Dobson was at a surface mine in Botswana. Hundreds of thousands of tons of fickle rock did not threaten above Dobson&#x2019;s head. <p></p>Dobson could get to Capetown in less than three hours from even the most distant company mine in Southern Africa. There were places in Capetown, good food, warm beds, and warmer women ranging from pale, ghostly white to dark, smooth ebony. And then Dobson would be stopping to meet with diamond cutters in Tel Aviv where, in spite of the slight threat of suicide bombers, he would stay overnight in a luxury suite in the Dan Tel Aviv Hotel. Luc, on the other hand, would spend the night in a visitor&#x2019;s room in the four-story concrete block that housed the mine&#x2019;s middle-management workers here in Devochka. <p></p>Luc knelt next to the wall to his right. He had insisted on coming this way, even climbing over the dust-covered yellow machinery and down the slight incline. There was a feel of something this way. <p></p>His guide, an old night-duty mine watchman, Boris Antonovich, had told him that this shaft needed shearing up. Boris, tall, sullen, hulking, and bearded would not have been Luc&#x2019;s choice as a guide, but Boris had one advantage. He could speak a little French. <p></p>Luc had not even bothered to answer when Boris issued his warning about the shaft. The geologist had simply gone down the tunnel, examining the walls, taking samples, seeing nothing of great interest, going deeper and deeper, farther and farther. And then he had noticed that Boris was not behind him. <p></p>Probably back there sulking because Luc had come this way instead of to the tunnel to the right that Boris had suggested. <p></p>"This is an old shaft," Boris had said. "It&#x2019;s not worked anymore." <p></p>Luc had known this. <p></p>"It is dangerous," Boris had said. <p></p>"Danger is relative," Luc answered. <p></p>"Physical danger is absolute." <p></p>A Russian philosopher in Siberia. Just what Luc needed. <p></p>"I&#x2019;m going in," Luc had said. <p></p>Boris had shrugged and shook his head. <p></p>The large tunnel was arched, with a craggy roof and wall and an even, flat floor. Rubber-reinforced trucks, with beds that could hold 10,000 tons of ore, had ample room to rumble into the darkness at the end of the yellow tunnel. <p></p>Boris&#x2019;s arguments for not going into this particular shaft were very persuasive, but not in the way the Russian desired. The more Boris warned, the more determined Luc had been to go this way. In a battle of wills between a Russian and a Canadian, the man with the money and the gun will always win. Luc had a gun. <p></p>Luc was no fool. He had started carrying the weapon at first because of the stories others had told about being threatened, attacked. Rumor was that an Australian geologist who worked for the company had been beaten to death at a mine site in the Outback. <p></p>Luc, on his third trip to a site, had been attacked by a black mine worker in Namibia. The man was tall, lean, his open shirt revealing taut muscles, his face revealing rage, his mouth spewing, cracking with a babble of language Luc didn&#x2019;t understand. <p></p>In the man&#x2019;s right hand had been a rock. He had run at Luc, who was aware of voices, dark faces behind the man with the rock. Luc had fired. Once. The lean man fell to his knees, still looking at Luc, still babbling. The lean man didn&#x2019;t die. He had attacked Luc because he was the only white man present. He had attacked Luc because the man&#x2019;s wife had died and the man didn&#x2019;t have enough money to bury her properly. He blamed the mine, the humming, dark, maddening tunnels. He blamed the managers, the vague sense of the mine&#x2019;s white owners. <p></p>The doctor who operated on the crazed man to remove the bullet told Luc that his patient&#x2019;s babbling had been a rant ending with, "It is alive. It breathes. It waits." <p></p>So Luc carried a small but effective gun in the leather bag over his shoulder. <p></p>He knelt. He looked. He focused his laser flashlight on the wall in front of him. Someone had covered a four-foot section of the wall with dirt that almost matched the rest of the wall. Most people wouldn&#x2019;t have noticed. <p></p>Luc rubbed at the dirt-covered wall, took out a chemical spray, and washed a section. Even before the spray finished its work, Luc could see what had been hidden, a wooden panel about three-feet square. The panel had been carefully covered with chips of rock and dirt to simulate the surrounding wall. <p></p>Luc removed the panel and placed it against the tunnel wall. Then he shined his light inside a cave that extended about six feet into the rock. Luc crawled into the cave, coughed, and examined the walls around him. <p></p>He could see immediately. He needed no tests. An untrained eye would see nothing. Luc saw everything. He chipped away a small outcrop to his right, just above his head. Bits of rock rained down on his head and back. He examined the rocky ore in his hand <p></p>and decided. It was, if he were not mistaken, a reasonably rich outcropping. <p></p>Considering the size of the cave and the quality of what he had in his hand, Luc concluded that someone had removed millions of rubles worth of uncut jewelry-quality diamonds from the&#x2014; <p></p>Someone was singing. <p></p>Luc, still holding the rock sample, crawled back out of the small cave and took out his gun. He sat with his back against the tunnel wall and listened. <p></p>It sounded like the voice of a child, a child singing in Russian in a beautiful, clear voice that echoed sweetly through the tunnel, a funereal cathedral echo. <p></p>The voice was coming closer. <p></p>Luc got to his feet, dropped the rock into his case, and ripped the filter mask from his face. <p></p>The tunnel lights went out. <p></p>Luc was not a whimpering baby. He had served in the army, saw combat in Bosnia, had his share and more of barroom fights. Someone was playing games in the darkness. Fine, he would play too. <p></p>Luc turned on his flashlight and aimed it down the tunnel. The child&#x2019;s voice came closer and Luc could see a flickering light heading toward him, casting shadows on the tunnel walls. <p></p>He waited, cursing his heavy breathing. <p></p>It was definitely the voice of a child, singing a Russian song he thought he had heard before. <p></p>"Who are you?" he called out, his voice determined, strong, echoing. <p></p>The child kept singing. <p></p>Then she appeared. Alone. Small. Hair brushed down, dark, streaming over her shoulders and down the front of her white, white dress. In her left hand was a lamp, an old oil mining lamp, a kind that, Luc was certain, had never been used down here. <p></p>The child stopped. She was no longer singing. <p></p>Luc could see no one behind her. <p></p>The diamond thieves probably thought he wouldn&#x2019;t shoot a child. Maybe they were right. But there had to be adults not far behind her. He could simply walk past her, gun in hand, at the ready, and make his way back down the tunnel. <p></p>Did they know he had a gun? <p></p>Did they know he had found the small cave? <p></p>And where the hell was Boris? <p></p>The child smiled at him showing unexpectedly clean and even small white teeth. Russians did not have clean, even white teeth, not even the children. <p></p>Luc inched his way along the wall looking for trouble, ready for trouble, deciding not to send a warning shot into the darkness, deciding not to let them know he had a gun. <p></p>He was even with the child now. She had watched him move along the wall, scraping his head on the jagged rocky surface. She couldn&#x2019;t have been more than ten or eleven years old. The light from the lamp in her hand cast shadows on her face, her eyes showing clear and blue. <p></p>She looked at his gun and kept smiling. <p></p>A sound down the shaft. Luc turned his flashlight toward it. There was nothing there. He sensed a scuffling, turned the light back to where the girl had been standing. She was gone. He aimed the beam toward the cave he had uncovered. The girl was standing before it, her lamp now held low. The shadows had turned her face hooded and skull- like. <p></p>Luc was afraid, undecided. Should he leave her and run? Should he shoot her? Should he take her hand and lead her out of <p></p>the darkness? <p></p>No. He couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to touch her. <p></p>The hell with it. He hoped he had enough bullets for whoever was waiting in the black oblivion. He turned his back on the girl, aimed his flashlight toward wherever disaster was lurking, and took a step. <p></p>Behind him the girl started to sing again. <p></p>It struck him in the dark of a diamond mine in Siberia that he had never heard his five- year-old son sing. Luc wondered if he ever would. <p></p>Excerpted from People Who Walk in Darkness by Stuart M.

The art of pleasing, Richard Wendorf contends, was as much a part of Reynolds's success--in his life and in his work--as the art of painting. The author's examination of Reynolds's life and career illuminates the nature of eighteenth-century English society in relation to the enterprise of portrait-painting. Conceived as an experiment in cultural criticism, written along the fault lines that separate (but also link) art history and literary studies, <i>Sir Joshua Reynolds: The Painter in Society</i> explores the ways in which portrait-painting is embedded in the social fabric of a given culture as well as in the social and professional transaction between the artist and his or her subject. In addition to providing a new view of Reynolds, Wendorf's book develops a thoroughly new way of interpreting portraiture. </p><p> Wendorf takes us into Reynolds's studio to show us the artist deploying his considerable social and theatrical skills in staging his sittings as carefully orchestrated performances. The painter's difficult relationship with his sister Frances (also an artist and writer), his complicated maneuvering with patrons, the manner in which he set himself up as an artist and businessman, his highly politicized career as the first president of the Royal Academy of Arts: as each of these aspects of Reynolds's practice comes under Wendorf's scrutiny, a new picture of the painter emerges--more sharply defined and fully fleshed than the Reynolds of past portraits, and clearly delineating his capacity for provoking ambivalence among friends and colleagues, and among viewers and readers today. </p></p><p><b>Richard Wendorf</b> is Director and Librarian of the Boston Athenaeum. Among his other books in eighteenth-century studies is <i>The Elements of Life: Biography and Portrait-Painting in Stuart and Georgian England</i>.You practice an art ruled by men. Worse still, it is one in which your brother is preeminent. This was the delicate position in which Frances Reynolds, professional portraitist and the sister of Sir Joshua, found herself--which is only one of the fascinating highlights of Richard Wendorf's portrait of the 18th century's most fashionable painter...The subtitle of <i>Sir Joshua Reynolds </i>suggests something of its originality, for it is not about the painter of society as much as the painter <i>in </i>society, revealing how the enterprise of portrait-painting illumines the nature of the period. (Robert Taylor <i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>Sir Joshua Reynolds probably provided more fodder for the would-be biographer than any other British artist who has ever lived...Why then does he remain so elusive? Richard Wendorf, in this hugely stimulating and subtly written study of Reynolds's social life and times, gets nearer to answering that question than anyone else to date. At the heart of Wendorf's text is an investigation of how Reynolds shaped his own persona in order to accommodate others and guarantee his own continued professional advancement. The key word, and one which his contemporaries used in describing him, is 'complaisance'...Reynolds could, when he wished, charm the birds from the trees. He could also be ruthless. Somehow Wendorf resists the temptation to play judge and jury, maintaining a reflective and fair-minded impartiality...Despite the mass of information encountered by Wendorf, few stones are left unturned. In factual terms, Wendorf achieves a high degree of accuracy...Wendorf may not lead one to love Reynolds, but he demonstrates that he remains a pivotal figure for anyone who seeks to understand the interstices of eighteenth-century cultural life.

Now Philip Eade has delivered an authoritative and hugely entertaining biography that is full of new material, much of it sensational.</p><p>Eade builds upon the existing Waugh lore with access to a remarkable array of unpublished sources provided by Waugh&#x2019;s grandson, including passionate love letters to Baby Jungman &#x2013; the Holy Grail of Waugh research - a revealing memoir by Waugh&#x2019;s first wife Evelyn Gardner (&#x201c;Shevelyn&#x201d;), and an equally significant autobiography by Waugh&#x2019;s commanding officer in World War II. </p><p>Eade&#x2019;s gripping narrative illuminates Waugh&#x2019;s strained relationship with his sentimental father and blatantly favoured elder brother; his love affairs with male classmates at Oxford and female bright young things thereafter; his disastrous first marriage and subsequent conversion to Roman Catholicism; his insane wartime bravery; his drug-induced madness; his singular approach to marriage and fatherhood; his complex relationship with the aristocracy; the astonishing power of his wit; and the love, fear, and loathing that he variously inspired in others.</p><p>One of Eade&#x2019;s aims is &#x2018;to re-examine some of the distortions and misconceptions that have come to surround this famously complex and much mythologized character&#x2019;.&#x2018;This might look like code for a plan to whitewash the overly blackwashed Waugh,&#x2019; comments veteran Waugh scholar Professor Donat Gallagher; &#x2018;but readers fixated on atrocities will not be disappointed . . . I have been researching and writing about Waugh since 1963 and Eade time and again surprised and delighted me.&#x2019;</p><p>Waugh was famously difficult and Eade brilliantly captures the myriad facets of his character even as he casts new light on the novels that have dazzled generations of readers.</p></p><p><b>Philip Eade</b> has worked as a criminal barrister, English teacher, and journalist. His first book, <i>Sylvia, Queen of the Headhunters</i>, was runner-up for the Biographers' Club Prize, and a <i>New York Times</i>' Editors' Pick; his second, <i>Prince Philip</i>, became a <i>Sunday Times</i> bestseller. He lives in London.<p>"Philip Eade has written a brisk, lively, and wonderfully entertaining account of the life of a strange, tormented, unique creature. Through page after page one finds oneself laughing aloud." &#x2015;John Banville, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br><i></i><br>"Although there have been several other excellent biographies of Evelyn Waugh, this is perhaps the most penetrating and insightful one to date.....For all the value of the newly available sources and the good use to which Mr. Eade has put them, in the end it is his biographical skills and crisp way with words and phrase that make this such a valuable tool for understanding the perplexing figure." &#x2015;Martin Rubin, <i>Washington Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Any biography of Waugh is entertaining because he was so witty a man, and Mr. Eade does not fail to entertain. He is not only fair to Waugh, moreover; he evidently likes him. It&#x2019;s good to read an admiring rather than a debunking biography.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;This crowded, witty biography follows Waugh from the ancestral home in Somerset...to the jungles of Brazil.... Eade plunges into correspondence and unpublished family papers to explore the writer&#x2019;s obsessions with social status and Catholicism, his jackknife turns from affection to contempt, and his torturous ambition.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p><i>"</i>Eade recounts Waugh&#x2019;s life in an admirably economic, straightforward manner, with a nice sense of measure and in a prose style free of jargon and clich�. He neither Freudianizes Waugh nor condemns his lapses into social savagery. Without a trace of tendentiousness, free of all doctrine, the biographer seeks to understand the strange behavior of his subject through telling the story of his life without commenting censoriously on it. The task is far from a simple one." &#x2015;Joseph Epstein, <i>The Claremont Review</i></p><p>"Entertaining and meticulously researched....Eade approaches his subject with empathy and an archaeologist&#x2019;s determination to excavate the past.... [He] skillfully narrates the ups and downs of the writer&#x2019;s life, from his conversion to Catholicism to his determined work on <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>during wartime. Waugh&#x2019;s episodes of outrageous behavior, heavy drinking, and generosity to fellow writers are all examined with admirable evenhandedness." &#x2015; <i>Harvard Review</i></p><p>"Unlike some of Waugh&#x2019;s biographers, Eade does not start from the premise that thetwentieth century&#x2019;s great master of English prose was a fiend in human form: a wise decision that allows him to see, and portray, a complex personality in full." &#x2015;George Weigel, <i>First Things</i><br><i></i><br>"One gets the sense throughout his work that Eade has set his hounds to sniff outthe documents and interviews that give the truth, even if unsensational, ratherthan the racy or amusing anecdote; yet in the end his evenhandedness serves tosharpen rather than blur the likeness he has crafted. In sum, Eade succeeds ingiving a convincing picture of a complex man&#x2015;one more interesting, in humanterms, than the portrait the artist gave us of himself." &#x2015;Paul V. Mankowski, <i>First Things</i></p><p>"[Eade&#x2019;s] new biography deconstructs the monster and reattaches the man to the human race." &#x2015;David Pryce-Jones, <i>National Review</i></p><p><i>"</i>For even more laughs, Philip Eade's <i>Evelyn Waugh: A Life Revisited </i>demonstrates that Waugh's life, already done by divers hands, really is worth another visit." &#x2015;John Banville, <i>GUARDIAN Best Books of 2016</i></p><p>"Eade's new biography draws on unpublished letters, diaries and memoirs to explore the eccentric larger-than-life story of one of the most acclaimed novelists of the 20th century. Will send readers back to the novels in droves." &#x2015;<i>FINANCIAL TIMES Books of the Year</i></p><p><i>"</i>Anyone with the slightest interest in Evelyn Waugh - and who has not been intrigued by his steady return to favour? - should buy, and keep, Philip Eade's <i>Evelyn Waugh: A Life Revisited</i>. Why? Because it is packed with brand new, fascinating information about Waugh, his family, his friends and lovers. As well, it &#x201c;rebalances&#x201d; a number of entrenched, skewed perceptions of man and soldier. And it is irresistibly readable." &#x2015;Donat Gallagher, editor of <i>THE ESSAYS, ARTICLES AND REVIEWS OF EVELYN WAUGH</i></p><p>"Essential . . . compelling . . . Eade's pacey new biography delivers the raw material of Waugh's life. . . . Treat the Waugh aficionado in your life." &#x2015;<i>SUNDAY TIMES Books of the Year</i></p><p> &#x201c;Eade is a gifted narrator and a master at providing the right quote at the right time at just the right length.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Washington Free Beacon</i></p><p> "Thoughtful and intimate.... Drawing on previously unavailable letters, manuscripts and diaries, Eade illuminates connections between Waugh's much-lauded fiction and the author&#x2019;s concealed emotional life.... A convincing portrait of a flawed but gifted artist.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</p><p>"Well crafted.... Eade focuses on Waugh's colorful personal life and exploits with the 'smart set' of his time.... Eade's treatment reveals a man of astonishing awareness of his gifts and failings, great sincerity, and wit." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p> "If you like your Waugh fast, furious, and funny, there is much to enjoy in Philip Eade's sparkling <i>Evelyn Waugh: A Life Revisited</i>.... Waugh's letters are a joy to read, and Eade's coup is his access to a hitherto unpublished cache of them." &#x2015;<i>The Times</i> (London)</p><p> "[Eade] is an assiduous researcher with a considerable narrative gift. He also, crucially, likes his subject. Waugh never much cared what anyone thought of him, but Eade does, and time and again he finds justification for what previous biographers have considered questionable behavior.... This is an exemplary piece of work." &#x2015;<i>The Daily Mail</i> (London)</p><p> "Brisk and entertaining.... intelligent and illuminating.... the best single-volume life of the author available. To read [this book] is to experience a reckoning with a man whose life, like his work, is both a solace and a stimulus." &#x2015;<i>Irish Times</i></p><p> "A bright, breezy, and sympathetic portrait." &#x2015;<i>The Mail on Sunday</i> (London)</p><p> "Read this book.... Eade is excellent on tracing the sources of Waugh's delights and horrors, from his life to his work and back again: the failures, the successes, the disappointments, the endless grist to the authorial mill." &#x2015;<i>Literary Review </i>(U.K.)</p><p> "There isn't a single dull page in the whole book, and it could easily be twice as long without overstaying its welcome." &#x2013; <i>The Irish Independent</i> (Dublin)</p><p> "It is the force of Waugh's energy&#x2015; &#x2013; creative, sexual and social&#x2015; &#x2013; that crackles through the pages of Philip Eade's meticulous and wildly entertaining biography.... . . . Eade supplies an astonishing wealth of detail... . . . and is sympathetic to Waugh's many failings without being sycophantic." �&#x2013; <i>Daily Express</i></p><p> "A splendid treat. Eade's exploration of the most significant episodes in the life of this fearless, deeply melancholic comedian is a most worthwhile addition to the bowing shelf of Waughiana." &#x2013; <i>iNews</i></p></p><h2>Charlie&#39;s Apprentice</h2><p>Having outlived the Cold War, Charlie Muffin is put out to pasture by his director as a teacher of fledgling spies, until an apprentice is captured in Beijing, and Charlie is sent on the dangerous rescue mission.</p><p><p>Brian Freemantle [b. 1936] is one of Britain's most acclaimed authors of spy fiction. His novels have sold over ten million copies worldwide. Born in Southampton, Freemantle entered his career as a journalist, and began writing espionage thrillers in the late 1960s. Charlie M (1977) introduced the world to Charlie Muffin and won Freemantle international recognition&#x2014;he would go on to publish fourteen titles in the series.&nbsp;<br><br>Freemantle has written dozens of other novels, including two featuring Sebastian Holmes, an illegitimate son of Sherlock Holmes, and the Cowley and Danilov series, about an American FBI agent and a Russian militia detective who work together to comabt organized crime in the post-Cold War world. Freemantle lives and works in London, England.</p>British spy Charlie Muffin, the wonderfully unorthodox hero of several seriocomic adventures by Freemantle, has been put into semiretirement, reduced by his new superiors to training fledgling agents. Charlie adjusts as best he can, forming a personal attachment with his first apprentice, John Gower, and a platonic relationship with the new director's secretary. Meanwhile, in Russia, KGB agent Natalia Fedova, having realized that Charlie had saved her life and career by aborting her planned defection to the West a few years back, decides to track down the rumpled spy in order to let him know that she's borne him a daughter; at the same time, she must guard against the jealous manipulations of a subordinate who wants to destroy her. And in Beijing, a Jesuit who doubles as a British agent finds himself in increasing jeopardy of exposure but refuses to leave his post, prompting the London office to send the unseasoned Gower in to bring him home. When Gower is captured and imprisoned by the Chinese, Charlie must rescue him before an international incident erupts. As usual with Freemantle, secrets hide within secrets, and one way or another, Charlie will have his revenge on those he finds wanting. The delightful way in which that revenge dovetails with Natalia's own designs makes for a most satisfying conclusion, reached amid a flurry of surprises and revelations. Superior work from a master of the form. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Woman of Substance</h2><p>Emma Harte, an enormously wealthy and powerful self-made woman, learns that her four children are plotting to sell the business that she founded, which leads her to summon everyone to her Yorkshire estate for a showdown</p><p><p><i>A celebration of an indomitable spirit, here is New York Times bestselling author Barbara Taylor Bradford's dazzling saga of a woman who dared to dream-and to triumph against all odds...</i></p><p><b>A WOMAN'S AMBITION...</b><br>In the brooding moors above a humble Yorkshire village stood Fairley Hall.

The book&#x2019;s contributors&#x2014;including bell hooks, E. Ethelbert Miller, Angela Davis, and others&#x2014;examine the personal and public issues embedded in family portraits and news photographs, movie stills and mug shots.</p><br></p><p>Deborah Willis is curator of exhibitions at the National African American Museum Project of the Smithsonian Institute. Her previous books include <i>Early Black Photographers: 1840 to 1940</i> and <i>VanDerZee: Photographer 1886&#x2013;1983</i>. She lives in Washington, D.C.<br>For this book, Willis invited 18 writers, critics, and filmmakers to select a photograph they found personally or historically significant and to provide an analysis of their selection. The contributors include Adele Alexander, Angela Davis, Kathe Sandler, Slarissa Sligh, bell hooks, and Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor, and the images they chose include treasured family portraits, a lynching, a stylish woman of the Harlem Renaissance, a famous 19th-century propaganda piece designed to help recently freed slaves from New Orleans, and a daguerreotype portrait of a black child holding a white baby. By chance, the result is a small sampling from each period of African American history since the invention of photography. Willis (VanDerZee: A Photographic History, LJ 11/15/93), who is associated with the Smithsonian Institution's National African American Museum Project, is known for her ground-breaking research and writing on the subject of African American photography.

Afterwards the young academic star joined the energy project of the Harvard Business School and wrote the best-seller Energy Future. Following on from there, <b>The Prize</b>, winner of the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction, is a comprehensive history of one of the commodities that powers the world--oil. Founded in the 19th century, the oil industry began producing kerosene for lamps and progressed to gasoline. Huge personal fortunes arose from it, and whole nations sprung out of the power politics of the oil wells. Yergin's fascinating account sweeps from early robber barons like John D. Rockefeller, to the oil crisis of the 1970s, through to the Gulf War.Daniel Yergin is a writer of international renown and president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a leading firm on political risk and economic analysis.

But very few know the story of how Brown was covertly aided by a circle of prosperous and privileged Northeasterners who supplied him with money and weapons, and, before the raid, even hid him in their homes while authorities sought Brown on a murder charge. These men called themselves the Secret Six.<br><br>The Secret Six included Thomas Wentworth Higginson, minister, author, and editor of the Atlantic Monthly; Samuel Howe, world-famous physician; Theodore Parker, the Unitarian minister whose rhetoric helped shape Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Franklin Sanborn, an educator and close friend of Emerson and Thoreau; and the immensely wealthy Gerrit Smith and George Luther Stearns.<br><br>The existence of the Six has been known to scholars, but there has never been a book devoted to them. Now, drawing on archives from Boston to Kansas, Edward J. Renehan, Jr., has created a vivid portrait of this unlikely cabal, showing how six pillars of the establishment came to believe that armed conflict was necessary in order to purge the United States of a government-sanctioned evil, slavery. The messianic zealot Brown -- also brilliantly portrayed-streaked across their path like a meteor. Renehan traces how the Six became involved with Brown, and how their lives were forever changed by the events at Harpers Ferry and the war they helped to start.</p><p>"In vivid prose, The Secret Six unravels the mysteries of the six prominent abolitionists who supported John Brown but abandoned him to his fate after the ill-starred raid at Harpers Ferry.

Saipan and Tinian had been under Japanese control since 1914 and, heavily colonized, they were considered virtually part of the Empire. The struggle for Saipan and Tinian was characterized by the same bitter fighting that typified the entire Central Pacific campaign. Fighting side-by-side, Army and Marine units witnessed the largest tank battle of the Pacific War, massed Japanese banzai charges, and the horror of hundreds of Japanese civilians committing suicide to avoid capture. In this book Gordon Rottman details the capture of these vital islands that led to the collapse of Prime Minister Tojo&#39;s government.</p><p>Highly visual guides to history&#39;s greatest conflicts, detailing the command strategies, tactics, and experiences of the opposing forces throughout each campaign, and concluding with a guide to the battlefields today.Gordon L Rottman entered the US Army in 1967, volunteered for Special Forces and completed training as a weapons specialist.

He is a winner of the New England Booksellers Association/NEBA Award for Best Fiction. -- the first time a writer of crime literature was so honored. His Joe Gunther detective series is one of the most enduring and critically acclaimed police procedural series being written today.Mayor delivers the strongest entry yet in his Joe Gunther series (after 2003's <i>Gatekeeper</i>) with this complex mystery tied to Gunther's personal life. Thirty-two years earlier, with his wife dying of cancer, a distracted Gunther allowed the investigation of a shopkeeper's murder to go cold. A new crime may be tied to it when a woman shoots her ex-husband with a gun the cops trace to the decades-old unsolved killing. Although it isn't Gunther's case now, he determines to find the link between the past and present crimes, in order to understand his younger self and the unresolved traumas of his early marriage and career. Gunther is an intuitive detective, and it's a treat to follow him as he analyzes subtle clues and teases leads from the unwilling or unwitting. He also must examine his relationship with his longtime lover, Gail Zigman, who's running for the state senate, when he discovers her opponent is backed by a suspect. A Vermont assistant medical examiner, Mayor delights in shedding new light on old evidence using modern forensic techniques that help Gunther solve this labyrinthine case.

Charged with murder, he was acquitted three years later in a nonjury trial. Although Katz ( Death in Rome ) does not directly argue that Andre pushed his wife to her death, his post-trial investigation turned up new evidence that casts doubt on the defense's claim that Mendieta's death was accidental or a suicide. At the time of the trial, it was divulged that she had a crippling fear of heights and avoided windows, and that Andre had scratches on his body the night of his wife's death. And the fact that Mendieta, who was planning to file for divorce, had photocopied documentation of her husband's suspected infidelities was deemed inadmissible. Katz's shocking police procedural is at once a glimpse into the tight, elitist New York art world, an affecting portrait of a Cuban-American woman artist, and an act of remembrance. Photos. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.On September 8, 1985, Soho artist Ana Mendieta fell 34 floors to her death. After slow progress through the judicial system, Ana's husband, renowned minimalist artist Carl Andre, was tried for murder and found not guilty. Katz takes the often-told story of love and marriage gone wrong and makes it fascinating by vividly describing the New York art scene of which Andre and Mendieta were an integral part. Soon after Mendieta's death, this world split into two warrings camps, and Katz, whose sympathy lies with the Mendieta camp, essentially accuses Andre's followers of closing ranks, protecting him at all costs, and making it impossible for the prosecution to prove its case. A gripping story, very well told. Highly recommended. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 1/1/90.<br><i>- Sandra K.

She lives in South Danbury, New Hampshire. Visit www.marylynray.com.Kindergarten-Grade 3-Ray takes readers on a nostalgic journey to turn-of-the-century rural New Hampshire, where Anna's parents realize that their seven-year-old daughter has a gift for music. They buy her a piano, and she makes weekly train trips into Boston-107 miles away-to take lessons. She practices constantly-so much so that her family nicknames her "Pianna." When she marries at age 17, she begins to raise her family and the lessons stop, but she continues to play-at churches, for the Grange, but mostly for herself. As the story ends, her husband has died and her children have grown up and moved away, but she still has her piano and still lives in the house her father built so long ago. In fact, "She may be playing now." Anna never achieves fame because of her talent; she simply nurtures it so that it brings her a lifetime of personal pleasure-not a bad message in our overly competitive society. Henba's soft acrylic illustrations, somewhat reminiscent of those in Barbara Cooney's Miss Rumphius (Viking, 1982), give a definite sense of time and place to the story and complement the easy flow of the text.

After more than four years of desperate fighting, with victories sometimes measured in feet and inches, why did the Allies reject the option of advancing into Germany in 1918 and taking Berlin? Most histories of the Great War focus on the avoidability of its beginning. This book brings a laser-like focus to its ominous end-the Allies' incomplete victory, and the tragic ramifications for world peace just two decades later.</p><p><br></p><p><br>In the most comprehensive account to date of the conflict's endgame, David Stevenson approaches the events of 1918 from a truly international perspective, examining the positions and perspectives of combatants on both sides, as well as the impact of the Russian Revolution. Stevenson pays close attention to America's effort in its first twentieth-century war, including its naval and military contribution, army recruitment, industrial mobilization, and home-front politics. Alongside military and political developments, he adds new information about the crucial role of economics and logistics.</p><p><br></p><p><br>The Allies' eventual success, Stevenson shows, was due to new organizational methods of managing men and materiel and to increased combat effectiveness resulting partly from technological innovation. These factors, combined with Germany's disastrous military offensive in spring 1918, ensured an Allied victory-but not a conclusive German defeat.</p></p><p>David Stevenson is Professor of International History at London School of Economics.Stevenson makes an important contribution to our understanding of the events of 1918. This is a major scholarly achievement, bringing together an analysis of the events of 1918 unlike any other book available. (Michael S. Neiberg, author of <i>Dance of the Furies: Europe and the Outbreak of World War I</i>)<br><br>Historian David Stevenson's meticulously researched book starts as the new Russian communist government makes a separate peace with Germany and her allies, releasing nearly a million troops from the Eastern Front. Allied losses during the previous three years had been catastrophic and while America had come into the war, its intervention seemed likely to be too little too late. Stevenson describes how Ludendorff's doomed offensive Operation Michael proved disastrous for the Germans. He pinpoints the American action far earlier than anyone had thought possible as one of the key factors that led to the Allies' unexpected but overwhelming victory in 1918. (<i>Oxford Times</i> 2011-05-26)<br><br>What David Stevenson achieves is a magisterial single volume synthesis of all the themes to deliver a punchy, incisive reboot of WWI history that is never a dull read...In saluting the unsung elements of victory, Stevenson ensures his big themes book is myth-busting in its small detail, too. (Charles Strathdee <i>Warships</i> 2011-07-01)<br><br>An immensely useful study, emphasizing the crucial importance of morale, political stability and trust. (Max Egremont <i>Literary Review</i> 2011-05-01)<br><br>While the Great War is hardly a neglected subject, its final phase has not previously been the subject of a single-author study that gives equal attention to both sides of the conflict. This book fills that void. Drawing on archival research in several countries, Stevenson explores the events and decisions that led to Germany's defeat in 1918, analyzing the reasons for Allied success and the collapse of the Central Powers. The strength of the book lies in his ability to weave together astute analysis of the antagonists' abilities and weaknesses, from food supply to finance, strategy to technology, and logistics to morale...Stevenson delivers on his promise to write a definitive account of the military history of the Great War's endgame. (Robert Gerwarth <i>Irish Times</i> 2011-05-28)<br><br>A magnificent and exhaustive account of the war's final year...Stevenson has a deserved reputation as one of the world's leading authorities on the war...Drawing on numerous original sources in French, German, Italian and English, Stevenson displays masterly scholarship and his prose is crisp and vivid throughout...A book that promises to be the outstanding military history published in 2011. (Tony Barber <i>Financial Times</i> 2011-05-27)<br><br>Brilliant and comprehensive...One of the many merits of Stevenson's book is his analysis of the sustainability of the war efforts of both sides in terms of the development and production of weaponry, food supplies, finance and morale, and the way resources interacted with, and weakened or strengthened, the ability of armies...What weight should be given to the failure of the German offensive as opposed to other, more long-term considerations in determining the defeat of the Central powers? A major debate among historians of the "total wars" of the 20th century concerns where the balance lies between the battlefield and the strength of combatants' economies in determining the eventual victors, and Stevenson's comprehensive study is a major contribution to this debate. (A. W. Purdue <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2011-05-26)<br><br>Stevenson brings to his study a formidable authority and mastery of the sources, and judgments that seem admirably measured and nuanced. (Max Hastings <i>Sunday Times</i> 2011-05-15)<br><br>Wide-ranging and clearly argued...This is, as one would expect from a historian of Stevenson's great learning and analytical power, a masterly study of the year that began with Allied demoralization and defeat, yet ended with the complete collapse of the Central Powers. Dragged down by the desertion of its allies, undermined from within by strikes, pacifist propaganda, mutinies and finally red revolution, Germany's tired, hungry and overstretched front-line armies were in no state--physically or psychologically--to resist superior Allied technology and numbers. Allied victory ended the war--but, as Stevenson brilliantly shows, it could have had a very different outcome. (Nigel Jones <i>The Telegraph</i> 2011-06-07)<br><br>The final months of WWI have been subjected to increasing attention by specialists. What has been lacking to date is a comprehensive analysis explaining why the conflict ended when it did. Stevenson complements <i>Cataclysm</i>, his political history of the war, with this definitive account of the final stages...The decisive counteroffensive, extending across Europe and into the Middle East, reflected above all the ability to manage resources at all levels, from a "superstructure of intergovernmental institutions" to the front lines of increasingly open, mobile warfare. Stevenson's detailed, lucid description of the development and maturation of that ability reflects encyclopedic mastery of published and archival sources while synergizing military, economic, political, and social-cultural factors. It is a professor's page-turner. It is also a door-opener to any reader seeking to understand the Great War's last stage.

At eleven, he&#39;s much too old to have an imaginary friend, yet they find him talking to and arguing with a presence that even he admits is not physically there. This presence - Chocky - causes Matthew to ask difficult questions and say startling things: he speaks of complex mathematics and mocks human progress. Then, when Matthew does something incredible, it seems there is more than the imaginary about Chocky. Which is when others become interested and ask questions of their own: who is Chocky? And what could it want with an eleven-year-old boy? A story of innocence and alien contact, Chocky is a sinister tale of manipulation and experimentation from afar.</p><p>John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Benyon Harris was born in 1903.

Constantly harassed by the jackals of the Viennese court, Elisabeth came to despise her adopted land and spent her life rejecting the obligations of a Habsburg empress, wife, and mother. Drawing heavily on Elisabeth's correspondence and that of those closest to her, Hamann presents Elisabeth as an ultraneurotic with few endearing traits. Though it is certain to entertain many, the work is too introspective in approach and fails to give any significant insight into the forces that were beginning to tear old Austria asunder during Elisabeth's reign.

Are our bodies and brains truly at odds with modern life? Although it may seem as though we have barely had time to shed our hunter-gatherer legacy, biologist Marlene Zuk reveals that the story is not so simple. Popular theories about how our ancestors lived&#x2015;and why we should emulate them&#x2015;are often based on speculation, not scientific evidence. <p>Armed with a razor-sharp wit and brilliant, eye-opening research, Zuk takes us to the cutting edge of biology to show that evolution can work much faster than was previously realized, meaning that we are not biologically the same as our caveman ancestors.</p><p>Contrary to what the glossy magazines would have us believe, we do not enjoy potato chips because they crunch just like the insects our forebears snacked on. And women don&#x2019;t go into shoe-shopping frenzies because their prehistoric foremothers gathered resources for their clans.</p><p>As Zuk compellingly argues, such beliefs incorrectly assume that we&#x2019;re stuck&#x2015;finished evolving&#x2015;and have been for tens of thousands of years. She draws on fascinating evidence that examines everything from adults&#x2019; ability to drink milk to the texture of our ear wax to show that we&#x2019;ve actually never stopped evolving. Our nostalgic visions of an ideal evolutionary past in which we ate, lived, and reproduced as we were &#x201c;meant to&#x201d; fail to recognize that we were never perfectly suited to our environment. Evolution is about change, and every organism is full of trade-offs.</p><p>From debunking the caveman diet to unraveling gender stereotypes, Zuk delivers an engrossing analysis of widespread paleofantasies and the scientific evidence that undermines them, all the while broadening our understanding of our origins and what they can really tell us about our present and our future.</p> 15 illustrations</p><p>Marlene Zuk is a professor of ecology, evolution and behavior at the University of Minnesota. The author of Paleofantasy and Sex on Six Legs, she lives in St. Paul, Minnesota.&#x201c;We tend to idealize our ancestors, as if they had the perfect life and perfect diet. In highly readable style, Marlene Zuk downplays our paleo-heritage. Not only did we change culturally, we are also genetically a different animal.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Frans de Waal, author of <em>The Bonobo and the Atheist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Marlene Zuk&#x2019;s quest to understand prehistory is an elegant guide for the perplexed. <em>Paleofantasy</em> cuts through a confusing tangle of facts and claims to give us a trustworthy road map to the glorious problems of who we are and where we come from.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard Wrangham, author of <em>Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In thoroughly engaging and witty prose, Zuk (<em>Sex on Six Legs</em>), a biologist from the University of Minnesota, dismantles the pseudoscience behind nostalgic yearnings for our caveman days.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Nothing beats good hard data to debunk myths, and Zuk offers plenty.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this illuminating overview of state-of-the art evolutionary science, [Zuk] debunks this utopian ideal and demonstrates that not only have humans continued to evolve since our foraging days, but some of those adaptations have been remarkably swift.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Carl Hays, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Ms. Zuk&#x2019;s nutritionally rich scientific fodder will certainly bring intellectual benefits far greater than those provided by the pseudoscientific confections with which we are so often tempted.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Cordelia Fine, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Zuk doesn&#x2019;t deny that an understanding of evolution can provide important insights into human behavior and health. But as this informative book demonstrates, the work of using evolutionary logic to explain human traits is more like multi-variable calculus than simple arithmetic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Daily Beast</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In her witty and well-researched prose, Zuk debunks these pseudoscience-based conceptions and proves that humanity did not have &#x201c;a time&#x201d; like the kind depicted by these fantasies; evolution has always been and will continue to be a key player in our species&#x2019; future.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Liz Belliovskaya, <em>Brain World Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Paleofantasy</em> is not another self-help book offering answers on how to eat, exercise, or love better in our evolving world. Instead, Zuk emphasizes that we can approach these aspects of our lives differently based on our genetic makeup.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Catherine Woods, <em>Science Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Zuk ably presents a skeptical and light-hearted view of a long list of palaeofantasies and supposed solutions.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Hawks, <em>Nature</em></strong></p><h2>The Homeowner&#39;s Guide to Renewable Energy: Achieving Energy Independence from Wind, Solar, Biomass and Hydropower (Mother Earth News Wiser Living Series, 3)</h2><p>Presents information on how to improve a home&#39;s energy efficiency and switch to renewable energy resourses to provide electricity, hot water, heat, and cooling for a home.</p><p>Dan Chiras is a respected educator and author who has published more than 25 books on residential renewable energy and green building.

As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.&#34; - Fr�d�ric Bastiat</p><p>Frederic Bastiat was born in Bayonne, Aquitaine, France. When he was nine years old, he was orphaned and became a ward of his father&#39;s parents. At age seventeen he left school to become more involved with his family&#39;s business as an exporter. Economist Thomas DiLorenzo suggests that this family business experience was crucial to Bastiat&#39;s later work because it allowed young Fr�d�ric to acquire first-hand knowledge of some of the effects of trade regulations on the market. Sheldon Richman notes that &#34;he came of age during the Napoleonic wars, with their extensive government intervention in economic affairs.&#34; When Bastiat was twenty-five, his grandfather and benefactor died, leaving the young man the family estate and providing him with the means to further his own theoretical inquiries. His areas of intellectual interest were diverse, including &#34;philosophy, history, politics, religion, travel, poetry, political economy, [and] biography.&#34; His public career as an economist began only in 1844, and was cut short by his untimely death in 1850. Bastiat had contracted tuberculosis, probably during his tours throughout France to promote his ideas, and that illness eventually prevented him from making further speeches (particularly at the legislative assembly to which he was elected in 1848 and 1849) and took his life. Bastiat died in Rome on 24 December 1850.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>NRA Guide Basics of Pistol Shooting 3rd edition</h2><p>New spiral bound book, not hardback. 3rd edition, 2015.</p><p></p><h2>The Promise of Joy</h2><p>When nuclear war breaks out between Russia and China, President Orrin Knox, aided or opposed by the media, senators, congressmen, cabinet officials, ambassadors, and the people, acts to safeguard peace and democracy in America and the world</p><p>The late Allen Drury was for twenty years a Washington correspondent covering principally the Senate, with occasional assignments to the House, the White House, Pentagon, Supreme Court, and United Nations for the UPI, The&#34; &#34;Washington Star, &#34; and &#34;The New York Times.&#34; His first novel, &#34;Advise and Consent, &#34; won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.</p><h2>The Kat Who Walked In Beauty : The Panoramic Dailies Of 1920</h2><p><i>by George Herriman<br> The Kat Who Walked In Beauty</i> collects many rare and unique dailies from the 1910s and 1920s. Though many readers are aware of Herriman's dynamic Sunday pages, few know that during 1920, in what must have been an editorially unrestrictive period for Herriman, he drew some of the most graphic and brilliantly conceived daily strips ever created - they look like "mini-Sunday" strips. This nine-month stretch of dailies, never-before-reprinted, is among the treasures included in this collection. The collection includes many other Herriman gems, including the very first stand-alone <i>Krazy &amp; Ignatz</i> strips from 1911, and the illustrations from Herriman"s <i>Krazy Kat Jazz</i> pantomime/ballet, performed to captivated New York audiences in 1922. <br></p><p>George Herriman (1880-1944), the creator of Krazy Kat, was born in New Orleans and lived most of his life in Los Angeles, California. He is considered by many to be the greatest strip cartoonist of all time.The lofty reputation of Krazy Kat stems predominantly from the oversized Sunday installments, while the smaller daily strips Herriman drew concurrently have been largely neglected. This step toward rectifying that oversight starts with a handful of episodes from the feature's 1911&#x2013;12 beginnings, relatively crude efforts in which Herriman is getting a handle on his fledgling characters. By the time of a 1914 sequence included here, Krazy and Ignatz (Offissa Pupp wouldn't arrive on the scene until the following decade) are in klassic form, from their appearance to their distinctive patois and brick-based relationship. The book's high point is a nine-month run from 1920. Herriman has hit his stride, producing consistently brilliant strips that are every bit as drolly amusing and visually idiosyncratic as their Sunday counterparts, albeit necessarily restrained by their shorter format. The collection is rounded off with Herriman's program illustrations and composer John Alden Carpenter's notes for the 1922 New York performance of the jazz pantomime-ballet Krazy Kat. Fans of the ongoing series reprinting all the Sunday Krazy Kats shouldn't miss this essential supplement.

Now&nbsp;&nbsp;the scent of the stuff has brought every dreamer,&nbsp;&nbsp;drifter, and two-bit swindler to town.

Sheriff&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave Buckalew is a man too proud to give up and&nbsp;&nbsp;too stubborn to give in. He liked his town the way&nbsp;&nbsp;it was--before the bootleggers, brothels, and&nbsp;&nbsp;fortune-seeking roustabouts--and so did a lot of other&nbsp;&nbsp;hardworking decent folk.

Inhabiting Caprock, a place where people say, "If you aint's et, I'd be tickled to have your company," are, conveniently, the good guys: Slim McIntyre, the newly arrived, wide-eyed farm boy; Tracy Whitmore, the waitress Slim's courtin'; Dave Buckalew, the earnest sheriff who yearns for the pre-boom days; Choctaw, the brave but pithy Indian; Jolene, the straight-talkin', maternal madam; and Victor Underwood, the educated young speculator. Soon after Slim arrives, the bad guys--Big Boy Daugherty and his gangsters Turk, Irish, French and Sarge--start terrorizing the town. Despite Buckalew's efforts, no one will speak out against Daugherty, until Lydia, a prostitute, admits she saw a murder. Buckalew puts her in his witness protection program (his vacant ranch house), and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Slim and Choctaw help the nearly bankrupt Underwood drill his last-chance well. The novel's conclusion is as subtle as an oncoming train. With 19 novels to his credit, Kelton obviously has found an audience. Here he makes no higher claim than to portray a boom town, but even for that standard, Honor at Daybreak has too much hokum, too few surprises. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>No Place Like Home: A Black Briton&#39;s Journey Through the American South</h2><p><p>In 1997 Gary Younge explored the American South by retracing the route of the original Freedom Riders of the 1960s. His road trip was a remarkable socio-cultural adventure for an outsider. He was British, journalistically curious, and black.</p><p> As he traveled by Greyhound bus through the former Confederate states, he experienced an awakening. He felt culturally tied to this strange yet familiar place. Though a Briton by birth and the child of emigrants from Barbados, he felt culturally alien in his native land. In Dixie, however, he met African Americans whose racial distinctiveness was similar to his own. To local blacks he looked like a brother, while sounding intriguingly foreign. As he assessed their political rise in the South, he noted too how African American tradition seemed static and unchanged. It was a refreshing whiff of &#x201c;home.&#x201d;</p><p> Awakened to his own identity as a black in a predominantly white society and absorbed by a sense of southern myth and racial history, he produced this account, a blend of travel writing, historical research, wit, and social commentary. His probing examination of the Southland gives fresh perspective on race relations in America.</p><p> Originally published in England, <i>No Place Like Home </i>is &#x201c;more than a piece of travel writing,&#x201d; praised the <i>London Evening Standard</i>, &#x201c;[but] a compelling exploration of racial identity and the problems of growing up clever, black, and angry in small-town Stevenage. . . .

Updating his acclaimed <i>History of Twentieth-Century Russia</i> through 2002, Robert Service provides a panoramic perspective on a country whose Soviet past encompassed revolution, civil war, mass terror, and two world wars. He shows how seven decades of communist rule, which penetrated every aspect of Soviet life, continue to influence Russia today. This new edition also discusses continuing economic and social difficulties at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the military campaign in Chechnya, and Russia's reduced role on the world stage. </p></p><p>From the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 to the collapse of communism in 1991, from Lenin to Yeltsin, the history of Russia in the 20th century is a complex, tumultuous story of social, geographic, and political upheaval. Robert Service, a professor at the University of London's School of Slavonic and Eastern European studies, closely looks at this period in <i>A History of Twentieth-Century Russia</i>. Starting with the armed revolution between 1918 and 1921, Service examines the influence of Leninist philosophy on the Bolshevik movement, while at the same time analyzing the complex social dynamics taking place in the background. His intention is to understand the ingredients of "The Soviet Compound"--the synthesis of social and political Leninist techniques--and how it perpetuated the Soviet state for more than half a century. <p> Service is also keen to debunk the theory that it was merely fear and intimidation that explains the endurance of the state. He cites welfare reforms, education, and significant economic progress as a unifying force that brought a share of betterment into Russian society. Students of Russian history will find this book informative and surprisingly powerful, in particular, Service's narrative on the causes of the Soviet collapse, which he believes Gorbachev's radical social reforms brought about by inadvertently opening the door for dramatic change to take place. <i>--Jeremy Storey</i></p>In his fresh and lively survey of recent Russian history, Robert Service spans the whole era from the rise of communism in the first decade of this century to the aftermath of its collapse in 1991. It is far more than a comprehensive summary of the established facts, and provides an introduction to the results of Western and Russian research.-Economist</p><h2>Magic Knight Rayearth Omnibus Edition Volume 1</h2><p>Umi, Hikaru, and Fuu are three schoolgirls out on a field trip to Tokyo Tower, whisked suddenly away by a strange voice and light to Cephiro, a world full of spirits and sorcery.

With real panache and poetic flair, it returns us to an earlier moment in queer theoretical discourse we would associate with Lee Edelman&#x2019;s Homographesis (easily the best book ever written in queer theory and every page of The Penetrated Male reminded me of it), Calvin Thomas&#x2019; Male Matters, and Leo Bersani&#x2019;s &#x201c;Is the Rectum a Grave?&#x201d; Given the recent squeamishness ... in queer theoretical circles about shit, anality, and penetrability, there is real value (and it is not some sort of nostalgia for an earlier moment we might want to get back to) in this book which never shies away from any of these matters. As embodied and eroticized theory, it fills a much needed hole in contemporary discourse about the male body. It is a book I should like to have written.&#x201d; (Michael O&#x2019;Rourke)<p>Through nuanced readings of a handful of modernist texts (Baudelaire, Huysmans, Wilde, Genet, Joyce, and Schreber&#x2019;s Memoirs), this book explores and interrogates the figure of the penetrated male body, developing the concept of the behind as a site of both fascination and fear. Deconstructing the penetrated male body and the genderisation of its representation, The Penetrated Male offers new understandings of passivity, suggesting that the modern masculine subject is predicated on a penetrability it must always disavow. Arguing that representation is the embodiment of erotic thought, it is an important contribution to queer theory and our understandings of gendered bodies.</p></p><p>Jonathan Kemp teaches creative writing and comparative literature at Birbeck College, University of London.

Not that Deborah Knott, the sexy, smart young district court judge whose extended family of 10 siblings, a curmudgeonly father who used to be a moonshiner, and uncles, aunts, nephews, and nieces too numerous to count, bears any resemblance to the maiden ladies of that beloved British genre. But like her English counterparts, Maron eschews blood and gore, and concentrates instead on manners, mores, and motives. And she has few equals on either side of the Atlantic; she weaves telling portraits of ordinary people coping with out-of-the-ordinary circumstances, often in less than a couple of sentences, and tells the whole history of a landscape and a way of life in one short paragraph. In this tradition, <i>Home Fires</i> delineates the remnants of prejudice that linger like an indelible stain on the fabric of race relations in mostly rural Colleton County, North Carolina. When Deborah's family calls on her to help her teenage nephew, who's accused of vandalizing a family cemetery with racial epithets and hate slogans, she butts heads with an angry, aggressive, black female D.A., a charismatic preacher, and an activist and former Black Panther whose closet full of skeletons seems linked to the church arsons. As the plot unfolds, Maron brings the New South into focus, illuminating not only its physical beauty and the complexity of its inhabitants but also the changes and problems caused by integration. Deborah is a steel magnolia whose own fires smolder sexily in scenes with Kidd, her lover, and whose own values and beliefs come in for a penetrating reexamination in this newest in the popular series from Edgar, Agatha, Anthony, and Macavity Award-winning author Maron. <i>--Jane Adams</i>The author&#39;s first novel in this series, BOOTLEGGER&#39;S DAUGHTER, has over 125,000 copies in print and swept the top mystery awards for 1992, including the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Mystery, the Agatha, the Macavity, and the Anthony Award.

The creation myth is explored as the basis for government, the symbolism of political power, a description of the daily lives of the common people, instruction for the afterlife, and as the lesson at the heart of the famous Maya ballgame. Includes 16 pages of color photos, and many black and white illustrations. Freidel is an anthropologist who has collaborated for this book with art professor Linda Schele and writer Joy Parker. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p><p>David Freidel has been a Maya archaeologist for twenty years. He teaches at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. </p>How elements of the Maya creation myth can be found in ancient Maya art as well as in today's Maya folk culture. In A Forest of Kings (1990), Freidel (Archaeology/Southern Methodist University) and Schele (Art/University of Texas at Austin) shared their extensive knowledge lucidly; here, working with writing-instructor Parker, they go astray, throwing in occasional (mostly superficial) material on the shamanic tradition, awkwardly personalizing their intellectual quest. The authors claim to reverse the idea that the Conquest destroyed links between ancient Maya civilization and contemporary Maya. In fact, cultural survivals have long been documented, but Freidel and Schele do quite brilliantly recognize in detail previously unsuspected imagery and symbolic systems that connect present-day practice to ancient myth. Finding that creation myths parallel celestial events, Schele concludes that ``every major image from Maya cosmic symbolism was probably a map of the sky.'' (Interpretations here will fascinate enthusiasts of Giorgio De Santillana and Hertha Von Dechend's Hamlet's Mill, 1969, which contended that myth has an astronomical/cosmological, rather than historical, basis). The authors generously share credit with colleagues, unfortunately studding the already dense text with names of individuals and institutions. Attempts to dramatize the creative process fall flat (``One afternoon, Nikolai had arrived late after meetings in Guatemala City to find a contemplative Linda brooding over the structure of this very chapter''). Moreover, perhaps for political reasons, the recent Maya genocide is barely referred to, while the current cultural revival (in which the authors have played a role) is mentioned but left tantalizingly unexplored. Frustrating, irritating, hard to read--and not for the New Age audience the subtitle seems chosen to attract. Those with a serious interest in Maya myth, symbol, and art, though, can excavate much of value here. (Illustrations--250, including 24 pages color) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In a post-civil rights era defined by deindustrialization and globalization, hip-hop crystallized a multiracial, polycultural generation's worldview, and transformed American politics and culture. But that epic story has never been told with this kind of breadth, insight, and style.<br><br>Based on original interviews with DJs, b-boys, rappers, graffiti writers, activists, and gang members, with unforgettable portraits of many of hip-hop's forebears, founders, and mavericks, including DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, Chuck D, and Ice Cube, <i>Can't Stop Won't Stop</i> chronicles the events, the ideas, the music, and the art that marked the hip-hop generation's rise from the ashes of the 60's into the new millennium. Here is a powerful cultural and social history of the end of the American century, and a provocative look into the new world that the hip-hop generation created.<br></p><p>Many good books have been written about the history of hip-hop music and the generation that nurtured it. <i>Can't Stop Won't Stop</i> ranks among the best. Jeff Chang covers the music--from its Jamaican roots in the late 1960s to its birth in the Bronx; its eventual explosion from underground to the American mainstream--with style, including DJs, MCs, b-boys, graffiti art, Black Nationalism, groundbreaking singles and albums, and the street parties that gave rise to a genuine movement. But the book is about more than beats and rhymes. What distinguishes his book from the pack is Chang's examination of how hip-hop has shaped not only pop music, but American history and culture over the past 30 years. He shows how events such as urban flight, race riots, neighborhood reclamation projects, gang warfare in the Bronx and Los Angeles, and grassroots movements that influenced political agendas are as integral a part of the hip-hop story as the music itself. He also charts the concurrent rise of hip-hop activism and the commodification of the music and the ideological clashes that developed as a result.<p> Based on hundreds of interviews and over a decade of work as a respected music journalist, Chang offers colorful profiles of the lives and influences of "the trinity of hip-hop music"--Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, and DJ Kool Herc--along with many other artists, label executives, DJs, writers, filmmakers, and promoters. Impressive in its scope, <i>Can't Stop Won't Stop</i> is a lively and sharply written exploration of the power of hip-hop to unite people across generational, racial, and economic lines. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Jeff Chang has been a hip-hop journalist for over a decade and has written for <i>The San Francisco Bay Guardian</i>, <i>The Village Voice</i>, <i>Vibe</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>URB</i>, <i>Rap Pages</i>, <i>Spin</i> and <i>Mother Jones</i>.

He shares a cramped apartment in the south Bronx with his mother, his younger siblings and the ceaselessly scratching rats that infest the walls behind his bed. Barely a teenager, he is old beyond his years. The best thing in Bobby's life is Maria, his Hispanic friend. They are in love, and they have big plans for the summer ahead. Their lives are irrevocably shattered when a vicious Hispanic street gang attack the couple as they walk to school. With Bobby savagely beaten and Maria lying in hospital, terrified and engulfed by the pain of her badly burned face, <i>The Willow Tree </i>takes the reader on a volcanically powerful trip through the lives of America's dispossessed inner-city dwellers. Into this bleak and smouldering hinterland, however, Selby introduces a small but vital note of love and compassion. When Bobby's bruised and bloodied body is discovered by Moishe, an aged concentration camp survivor, an unlikely friendship begins. As Moishe slowly, painfully, reveals his own tragic story, Bobby struggles angrily with his desperate need for revenge.</p></p><p>The first novel in 12 years from the once-notorious author of Last Exit to Brooklyn is an embarrassingly cartoonish amalgam of West Side Story, Edward Lewis Wallant's The Pawnbroker, and--I kid you not--Dickens's A Christmas Carol. It's the story, told in Selby's characteristic long, claustrophobic paragraphs filled with unpunctuated run-on sentences, of a young black teenager rescued from the murderous hatred that threatens his own life by a lonely concentration camp survivor. Bobby and his Hispanic girlfriend Maria are savagely beaten by a gang of spic muthahfuckahs and left in the street to die. Maria does not survive, but Bobby is rescued by an elderly widowed handyman, Werner Schultz (who for obscure reasons calls himself ``Moishe''), who restores him to health, then tries to dissuade the anguished kid from seeking revenge. As Bobby regains his strength, Moishe gradually reveals the details of his family's imprisonment, their liberation from the camp and new life in America, and the loss of Moishe's only son to the Vietnam War. Bobby subsequently tracks down Maria's murderer, but, at the crucial moment, is unable to kill him. This simplistic novel's flaws are too numerous for brief summary. Suffice it to say that glaring improbabilities (Moishe's basement apartment contains, among other wonders, a workout room and Jacuzzi) and unrelenting sentimentality make it impossible to believe in the reality of Selby's characters, much less feel anything for them. Brief glimpses of Bobby's fatherless family and Maria's grieving women relatives are only token attempts to vary a sluggish narrative that resorts to such bathetic effects as a cleansing snowstorm that briefly obliterates the city's grime and Moishe's makeshift Christmas celebration, which presumably dries up the last remaining flecks of Bobby's ``righteous'' anger. Almost 40 years ago, Selby produced a white-hot vision of America's mean streets that remains a classic illustration of realistic fiction at its most brutally eloquent. It's becoming increasingly apparent that he's fated to be remembered as a one-book wonder. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>More than a decade after the publication of his story collection Song of the Silent Snow, Selby (Last Exit to Brooklyn) returns with a breathless and unconvincing tale of the fall and redemption of Bobby, a black teenager in the Bronx. At the start of the novel, Bobby and his girlfriend, Maria, are attacked by a Hispanic gang in punishment for their cross-ethnic dating. Bobby is beaten with a chain; Maria has lye thrown in her face and eventually dies. Refusing to be hospitalized, Bobby falls into the care of Moishe (aka Werner Schultz), a widower who survived the concentration camps (he claims, however, that he is not a Jew) and the death of his son in Vietnam. While Bobby plots an elaborate revenge against the Hispanic gang, Moishe seeks to impress on him the dangers of hatred and the importance of forgiveness, lessons he learned in the camps. Best read as a sort of fable, Selby's novel renders few details of ghetto life: the characters' incessant slang rings false, and the story's exact moment remains fuzzy (though the fact that the street weapons of choice appear to be knives and chains rather than semi-automatics would seem to put it somewhere in the past). Selby's characteristically chaotic prose removes the story even further from reality. What the novel does have is genuine passion, and Moishe's deep belief in forgiveness and acceptance win our sympathy, if not our belief. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tawny Scrawny Lion</h2><p>A lion tries to find a cure for his hunger</p><p><i>Once there was a tawny scrawny lion who chased monkeys on Monday?kangaroos on Tuesday?zebras on Wednesday?bears on Thursday?camels on Friday?and on Saturday, elephants!</i><br><br>So begins the funny, classic Golden story of a family of ten fat rabbits that teaches the hungry lion to eat carrot stew?so that he doesn?t eat <i>them!</i>Kathryn Jackson wrote dozens of Golden Books, among them The Saggy Baggy Elephant, which was also illustrated by Gustaf Tenggren.</p><h2>How to Be Your Own Veterinarian (Sometimes): A Do-It-Yourself Guide for the Horseman</h2><p>This item condition is New.

She lives with her husband in Denver, Colorado.<br>CHAPTER 1<br>&nbsp;<br>SOMETHING CAUSED MEN TO STARE at Nealie Bent, although just what it was that made them do so wasn&#x2019;t clear. Her body was more angles than curves, and her face, too, had all those sharp planes, far too many to be pretty. She was too tall to suit, and with her long legs, she took strides that were more like a man&#x2019;s than the mincing steps of a young girl. The dress she wore, one of only two she owned, was faded yellow calico, threadbare at the wrists and neck and of the wrong color to complement her pale skin. Her second dress was no better.<br><br>Still, men turned to look at Nealie Bent, for there was no question that the tall, thin girl was striking, or at least peculiar-looking, with her eyes the color of the palest blue columbines late in the spring, her hair such a pale red that it was almost the hue of pink quartz, and her face as freckled as a turkey egg. It could have been her youth that drew their attention. After all, Georgetown itself was still young, and youth was highly prized. Most of the young women there were already old, worn out from the work a mining town demanded of them and from childbearing. The Alvarado Cemetery was full of babies, with here and there a mother buried beside her newborn in that forlorn spot. Like all the mountain towns, Georgetown was a hard place, and folks there had a saying: Any cat with a tail is a stranger.<br><br>The same might be said in a slightly different way for a young woman, because any female with youth, such as Nealie, was new in Georgetown. But she would age quick enough. Still, for now&#x2014;and for a few years hence, perhaps&#x2014;the girl&#x2019;s youthfulness matched the spirit of the town, a place that was mightily attractive to those seeking to make their fortunes.<br><br>If it wasn&#x2019;t Nealie&#x2019;s youth that drew glances, then it might have been her air of innocence, and innocence was in even shorter supply in Georgetown than youth. But in that, the girl&#x2019;s appearance was a sham, for Nealie&#x2019;s short life had been a hard one. Though she knew more about the dark side of life than most her age, there was not even the hint of those hardships on Nealie Bent, and she appeared as fresh and guileless as a newborn.<br><br>So no one could put a finger on exactly what it was that made men take another look at Nealie, not that anyone in that town bothered to analyze. But no one doubted that they turned to stare at her as she passed them on the broad board sidewalk or paused in her rounds of shopping to peer into store windows at the delectable items she could only dream about buying.<br><br>Will Spaulding was no different from the rest of the men in his admiration. He&#x2019;d seen the girl as she filled her basket from the bins of apples and onions and potatoes. And now, as Nealie stood at the counter of the Kaiser Mercantile store, talking quietly with Mr. Kaiser, Will measured her with his eyes. She was five feet eight inches, only two inches shorter than he was. Will&#x2019;s eyes wandered over Nealie, taking in her slender build under the shabby dress, until he became aware that Mr. Kaiser was watching him and clearing his throat.<br><br>&#x201c;I said, &#x2018;What can I do for you, young man?&#x2019;&#x201d; the storekeeper repeated. The girl had placed her purchases in her basket and was turning to go, not sending so much as a glance at the man standing next to her.<br><br>Will cleared his throat, but he didn&#x2019;t speak immediately. Instead, he stared at the girl as she left the store and walked past the large glass window, leaving behind her soapy scent and the tinkling of the bell that announced customers. &#x201c;Who is she?&#x201d; he asked, as if he had the right to know.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s Nealie Bent,&#x201d; the older man replied, a look of bemused tolerance on his face. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not the first to ask. Did you come in for something or just to stare at the ladies?&#x201d;<br><br>Without answering, Will turned away from the door and looked at the shopkeeper. He removed a list from his pocket, laying it on the counter and smoothing it with his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m working up at the Rose of Sharon, and I&#x2019;ll be needing these things.&#x201d; He turned the list so that Mr. Kaiser could read it.<br><br>&#x201c;We take cash,&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser said, which wasn&#x2019;t exactly true. He extended credit to those in town who needed it, as well as to good customers such as Nealie&#x2019;s employer, but he did not extend the courtesy to strangers.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay it.&#x201d; Will&#x2019;s voice sounded as if he was not used to his credit being questioned. The older man moved his finger down the list, tapping a broken nail beside each item as he pronounced it out loud: &#x201c;Three pair work pants, three work shirts, cap, boots, jacket, gloves, candlesticks, candles.&#x201d; He droned on, and when he was finished, he said, &#x201c;Yep, you work at a mine, all right. You a trammer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Engineer. For the summer.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man&#x2019;s voice carried the slightest bit of authority as he corrected the misimpression, and Mr. Kaiser looked up and squinted at him, taking in the cut of his clothes, which made it obvious that Will was too fashionably dressed to be an ordinary miner. &#x201c;You somebody&#x2019;s son?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Will appeared taken aback at the impertinence, but he replied pleasantly enough, &#x201c;Grandson. I&#x2019;m William Spaulding. My grandfather&#x2019;s Theodore Spaulding. He owns half of the Sharon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Owns mines up in Leadville and Summit County, too,&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser added. Like everyone in the mountain towns, the shopkeeper was caught up in the mining fever and was as sure of the names of prominent investors as he was of those of his own customers. And well he might be, because outside capital was the lifeblood of the mining industry. Without development money, the gold and silver deposits were all but useless. Theodore Spaulding was not only a man of wealth but one respected in mining circles for his understanding of ore bodies and extraction methods. That did not make his grandson anything more than a trifler, however. &#x201c;So you thought you&#x2019;d see what goes on underground, did you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already seen what&#x2019;s underground. I have an engineering degree, so I know about mining, you see, at least theoretically. The old man thought I ought to get some practical experience for the summer. I&#x2019;ve only just arrived.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get it.&#x201d; Now that he seemed satisfied about his customer&#x2019;s identity, Mr. Kaiser returned to the list. &#x201c;I reckon we got everything you need.&#x201d; He moved around behind the counter, taking down boxes and holding out shirts and pants for sizes. He told Will to try on the heavy leather cap, then nodded, because the fit was right. Then he handed the young man two pairs of boots and told him to see which ones suited. Will sat down on a kitchen chair propped against the cold potbellied stove and removed his fine shoes. He clumped about on the floor in the stiff boots, and settled on one pair. Then he set his shoes on the counter and said that with all the mud on the streets, he might as well keep the boots on.<br><br>&#x201c;Socks. You&#x2019;ll need plenty of them, because the Sharon floods, and you don&#x2019;t want to get your feet wet. Worst thing there is, wet feet in a mine. If the water doesn&#x2019;t rot your feet, it&#x2019;ll give you pneumonia.&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser placed four pairs on top of the pile of clothing. He checked the list again, then pulled a dark blue bandana from a drawer and set it on top. &#x201c;Present,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Splendid! It will look grand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not for looks, Mr. Spaulding. You&#x2019;ll need the handkerchief to wipe your face when it&#x2019;s slashed with muck and cover your mouth and nose after a dynamite blast so&#x2019;s you won&#x2019;t get the miner&#x2019;s puff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then I thank you, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Kaiser licked the tip of the lead pencil he kept behind his ear and wrote the charge next to each item on the list, totaled the amount, and turned the paper toward Will, who pulled the money out of his pocket.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s one other thing I&#x2019;m needing,&#x201d; the young man said, as he watched Mr. Kaiser wrap the purchases in brown paper and tie the bundle with string. &#x201c;A boardinghouse. I&#x2019;m staying at the Hotel de Paris until my cottage is ready. Once I move in, I&#x2019;ll need a place to eat, because I don&#x2019;t fancy cooking for myself. Nor do I want to dress up every night for supper at the hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Georgetown&#x2019;s got a plenty of eateries.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Somewhere clean where the food is good.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That narrows it some.&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser thought a minute. &#x201c;You might try the Grubstake up on the hill. The bosses prefer it, since it&#x2019;s a good bit tonier than the others. Ma Judson&#x2019;s place is up on Main. She sets a good table. Then there&#x2019;s Lydia Travers&#x2019;s house on Rose Street. If I was you&#x2019;d, I&#x2019;d board with Mrs. Travers&#x2014;Lidie, she&#x2019;s called.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the best cook?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that.&#x201d;<br><br>Will waited.<br><br>&#x201c;Fact is, when it comes to cooking, Mrs. Travers&#x2019;s second to Ma Judson and not much better than the Grubstake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cleaner, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not so&#x2019;s you&#x2019;d notice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why should I take my meals there?&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Kaiser studied the young man a minute and chuckled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where Nealie Bent works.&#x201d;<br><br>Will reddened, and the shopkeeper added, &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t be the first to pick Mrs. Travers&#x2019;s place because of Nealie. But I ought to tell you she&#x2019;s all but spoke for by Charlie Dumas. He&#x2019;d marry her in a minute if she&#x2019;d have him.&#x201d;<br><br>Will took his bundle and started for the door, ignoring Mr. Kaiser&#x2019;s last words.<br><br>&#x201c;Best you take no notice of her, Mr. Spaulding,&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser called after him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s certain she took none of you.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man grinned and turned back to the counter where Mr. Kaiser stood fingering the canned goods.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>But in fact, Nealie Bent had taken considerable notice of young Will Spaulding. She had caught sight of him as she ran her hands through the bin of potatoes to find ones that were firm, with no rotten spots. She had glanced up and observed him through her pale lashes, taken in the young man&#x2019;s face, which was strong with no soft places, a little like a good potato. He was clean shaven, a nice thing, because Nealie was not partial to whiskers. Will&#x2019;s eyes were a deep brown with flecks of gold the color of aspen leaves in the fall, and his brown hair fell across his face in waves. He might have been the handsomest man she had ever seen, and certainly, he was the best dressed in a town where few wore anything but faded work shirts and rusty overalls.<br><br>She admired Will&#x2019;s jacket, a thick corduroy the color of a mountain sheep, that was handsomely tailored to fit his shape, not store bought at a place like the Kaiser Mercantile. He wore tight-fitting trousers that were better suited to a big city than a mining camp, and his shoes&#x2014;Nealie had to keep herself from smiling&#x2014;were of leather as fine as a glove and wouldn&#x2019;t last a day in the muck of the Georgetown streets.<br><br>The man was a stranger and a well-fixed one. And not for the likes of you, Nealie told herself as she pushed so hard at a soft spot in a potato that she broke the peel. She hastily placed the spoiled potato back in the bin, hoping Mr. Kaiser wasn&#x2019;t watching her. He was a bad one to tease, and she would die of mortification if he remarked on the way she had appraised the new fellow.<br><br>Such a man wasn&#x2019;t likely to notice her, she told herself. Nealie was not aware of the effect that she had on men, and if she had been, she would have been bewildered. Still, she wondered, as the young man came up to stand beside her at the counter while Mr. Kaiser wrote down her purchases on a piece of brown wrapping paper, what it would be like to be courted by such. Her mind wandered to thoughts of carriages and roses in the winter and diamond rings. But not for long. She could more easily find a gold mine than attract a man like this stranger, and so she turned her attention to Mr. Kaiser, double-checking his addition in her mind, because she was smart with numbers. Nealie considered questioning one of the figures so the young man would turn and look at her and maybe wish her a good morning, but she blushed at the thought, and without a word, she signed beside the amount entered in the ledger on the page that bore Mrs. Travers&#x2019;s name.<br><br>Then wishing that instead of her soundless cotton shift, she owned a satin petticoat with a ruffle to wear, a garment that would create a soft&nbsp;<i>whish</i>&nbsp;as she moved, Nealie turned to the door, shifting the basket from hand to arm to free her other hand for the handle. She went out then, forcing herself not to turn around for another look at the young man, and walked past the big window without so much as a backward glance. She would think about him later, for what was the harm in dreaming about matched horses and diamonds as thick as stars?<br><br>At the corner, she confronted the mud, slick as treacle, that was the street. The runoff from the snow had turned the dirt streets into a wet mass as thick as fudge. Although it was May, spring&#x2014;or what passed for spring&#x2014;had not quite reached the high country. Houses bore bare spots where the wind had scoured off the paint, and yards were covered with patches of late snow. But the drifts high up on the peaks were melting, and water cascaded down the gullies and through the streets. Although Nealie wore serviceable boots instead of slippers, she did not care to dirty them. It was an unpleasant chore to scrape off the mud that clung to them like glue and to oil the leather. She looked for dry spots in the muck or a board placed across the street for pedestrians, but such was not available. Nealie sighed and was just about to step into the brown stew when a man grabbed her arm.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll carry you across, Miss Nealie,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Remembering the man in the store, Nealie felt a wave of disappointment at the voice. Yes, Charlie Dumas could carry her as easily as if she was a feather. Charlie was a giant of a man, with the strength of a mule, and he could have picked up her and Mr. Kaiser and the stranger all at the same time and transported them across the street. But Nealie didn&#x2019;t want Charlie, who stood there with the neck buttons of his union shirt unbuttoned and his baggy pant legs tied to his boots with fuse cord. He snatched off his wide-brimmed hat, which had been rubbed with linseed oil to make it hard, and grinned at her. Charlie was altogether too familiar, and for reasons she didn&#x2019;t quite understand, she did not care to see the stranger come out of the store and find her in Charlie&#x2019;s arms. But it was that or muddy her boots and maybe her skirts, too. Besides, if the stranger had not noticed her in the store, he surely would pay no attention to her on the street. So Nealie said she was obliged and let Charlie lift her as easily as she did her basket and ferry her through the muck.<br><br>He walked slowly, furrowing his brow as if thinking of a way to prolong the trip through the mud. Then his face lit up, and he stopped in the middle of the street. &#x201c;Did I tell you I saw a man down by Taos Street in mud up to his neck? I told him that was deep muck.&#x201d; He grinned at Nealie to make sure he had her attention. &#x201c;That man told me, &#x2018;Stranger, it wouldn&#x2019;t be so bad if I wasn&#x2019;t sitting on a horse.&#x2019;&#x201d; Charlie guffawed as he watched Nealie hopefully, to see if she found the joke funny, and she laughed politely, although she&#x2019;d heard the tale two or three times already.<br><br>On the other side of the street, she escaped from Charlie&#x2019;s hold and struggled to stand up, putting as much distance as...</p><h2>Fences, Gates and Bridges: And How to Build Them (Man&#39;s Life Classic Library.)</h2><p>Written in 1900, this is a practical classic of American ingenuity. <br></p><p>This book is part of a series published by the Lyons Press re-introducing classic books of Americana the turn of the century.

As an American graduate student studying literature in Australia, Thompson traveled on vacation to New Zealand, where she met a Maori known as "Seven." Their relationship was one of opposites: he was a tradesman, she an intellectual; he came from a background of rural poverty, she from one of middle-class privilege; he was a "native," she descended directly from "colonizers." Nevertheless, they shared a similar sense of adventure and a willingness to depart from the customs of their families and forge a life together on their own. <br>In this extraordinary book, which grows out of decades of research, Thompson explores the meaning of cross-cultural contact and the fascinating history of Europeans in the South Pacific, beginning with Abel Tasman's discovery of New Zealand in 1642 and James Cook's famous circumnavigations of 1769&#x2013;79. Transporting us back and forth in time and around the world, from Australia to Hawaii to tribal NewZealand and finally to a house in New England that has ghosts of its own, <i>Come on Shore and We Will Kill and Eat You All</i> brings to life a lush variety of characters and settings. Yet at its core, it is the story of two<br>people who, in making a life and a family together, bridge the gap between two worlds.</p></p><p><p>Christina Thompson is the editor of <i>Harvard Review</i>.

In Washington, readers get broad strokes regarding the man's childhood and years at Mount Vernon, and then follow the time line into his military career. Specific moments in his career and in American history are highlighted, often in sidebars. Sacagawea follows the same format, beginning with the young woman's life with the Lemhi Shoshone and including her capture and subsequent sale by the Hidasta. Her role as interpreter for Lewis and Clark is shown as important to the success of their journey. Both books have sketchlike illustrations throughout. One drawback in these volumes is in the design. The placement of text boxes often interrupts the flow of the text and leads to some flipping back and forth to get all of the information. For example, a box outlining Washington's prowess in math but failure in spelling is placed mid-sentence, leaving readers to either abandon the sentence about his brother or flip back once it is read. The time lines are oriented horizontally, rather than vertically. The overall effect of these design choices detracts from the presentations.

Many moments of American history--from slavery to Jewish immigration, cholera to race riots, the birth of the working class to moon rockets--are attentively detailed. Especially impressive is the balance between formative events (such as the Civil War), lesser-known movements (American socialism between 1901 and 1920), and neighborhood vignettes (such as the making of black Harlem). <i>--Stephanie Gold</i>This is an invaluable resource tool for specialists and an enjoyable, information packed work for general readers with an interest in American history.

Is Your Hospital Ready To Compete in a Market That Keeps Getting Tougher and Tougher?</b><p>Hospitals have always felt pressure to provide excellent clinical care. And now that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been signed into law, that pressure has intensified. Increasingly, hospitals will face financial consequences for failing to live up to patient expectations of quality care.</p><p>HCAHPS results are directly linked to reimbursement. But they're also a barometer for measuring clinical performance and quality improvement. When hospitals raise their HCAHPS results, they also have fewer falls, lower infection rates, fewer readmissions - all the factors that impact reimbursement.</p><p>The HCAHPS Handbook is a practical resource filled with actionable tips proven to help hospitals improve patient perception of care. Because it's broken down by HCAHPS composites, readers can zero in on the parts of the survey that need attention. And the book provides a few carefully targeted tactics they can use to improve the results on each question.</p><p>Best of all, these tactics are foundational. They build on what most hospitals (particularly those that have implemented Studer Group's Evidence Based Leadership framework) are already doing. It's about working smarter, not harder. And ultimately, it's about hardwiring the behaviors and processes that lead to consistent excellence - and creating a culture of always.</p></p><p>The HCAHPS Handbook is a collaborative effort by three Studer Group leaders and HCAHPS experts.<p>Quint Studer, founder and CEO, spends much of his time creating, harvesting, and sharing best practices from his company's national learning lab of hundreds of organizations.

There was heartache, yes, but also something unexpected: hope. Peeling away the layers, Berry came to learn that the history of slavery cannot be quantified in simple, black-and-white terms of good and evil but is rather a complex tapestry of roles and relations, of choices and individual responsibility.In this poignant, reflective memoir, Berry skillfully relays the evolution of relations between the races, from slavery to Reconstruction, from the struggles of the Civil Rights movement and the Black Power 1970s, and on to the present day. In doing so, she sheds light on a picture of the past that not only liberates but also unites and evokes the need to forgive and be forgiven.</p><p><p>Bertice Berry, Ph.D., is a highly-sought-after motivational speaker to women&#x2019;s groups, book clubs, and Fortune 500 corporations. She is the author of the novels <i>Redemption Song</i>, <i>The Haunting of Hip Hop</i>, <i>Jim and Louella&#x2019;s Homemade Heart-Fix Remedy</i>, and <i>When Love Calls, You Better Answer</i>. She lives in Richmond Hill, Georgia.</p>Praise for <i>THE TIES THAT BIND</i><br><br>In Berry&#x2019;s first novel, <i>Redemption Song</i>, a contemporary love story unfolds as a pair of young strangers share reading the only extant copy of a slave narrative, the work of a woman who experienced deep love for a fellow slave and savage treatment from her owner. &#x201c;When I named the evil slave owner,&#x201d; Berry explains in this memoir, referring to her novel, &#x201c;I gave him the name of the man who owned the [Delaware] plantation that my family had lived on.&#x201d; Berry&#x2019;s mother had told her that &#x201c;Granddaddy said John Hunn was a good man,&#x201d; but Berry met such reports with utter disbelief. Her memoir is an act of contrition toward &#x201c;the man whose name I tried to tarnish&#x201d; as well as a journey of self-discovery and self-education as she uncovers the historical Hunn&#x2013;indeed, &#x201c;a good man.... a Quaker who risked life and limb in the fight for abolition&#x201d; and &#x201c;the southernmost conductor of the Underground Railroad.&#x201d; Berry weaves abolitionist history with autobiography (her single mother&#x2019;s struggle to raise a family of seven children; her own finding &#x201c;a way out of poverty through education&#x201d;). Berry&#x2019;s competently researched book, with its sprinklings of history, folklore and scripture along with a motivational thrust (&#x201c;We are all born with a purpose, a journey that must be completed&#x201d;), provide an accessible, readable introduction for others &#x201c;saddened... that none of this history had been made part of my education.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>Sociologist, motivational speaker and novelist Berry (<i>When Love Calls, You Better Answer</i>, 2005, etc.) digs deep to expose the roots of her family tree. In the introduction to this intensely personal journal of her life, the author admits to a major injustice in her debut novel <i>(Redemption Song</i>, 2000). For the character of an antagonistic plantation owner, she used the actual name of the man who had owned the plantation she was raised on in Delaware. Though her mother told her John Hunn was a good man she refused to believe it. Her memoir seeks to make amends to Hunn, an altruistic Quaker abolitionist and &#x201c;the southernmost conductor of the Underground Railroad,&#x201d; while concurrently presenting her family history, saturated with stories, lyrics, proverbs, literary quotations and sage words of spiritual inspiration. Berry praises the inner strength of her mother, a hard-drinking, pious single parent raising seven children on her own in Wilmington. Though they were &#x201c;cold and poor,&#x201d; she writes, their gloomy fatherless family life was leavened with laughter and an unshakable sense of reverence and hope. Determined to be educated and successful, the author also pined for love and married twice, once right out of graduate school and again for the sake of her children.

Their Tolkien calendar sold over one million copies (more than any calendar before or since) and their classic poster for a little film named Star Wars helped turn it into an unexpected worldwide phenomenon. This very special collection brings together Tim Hildebrandt's finest paintings and drawings, along with an account of his techniques and materials--from thumbnail sketches to finished works. Highly influenced by animation, especially Disney's early films, Hildebrandt has used his skill and passion to develop those traditions into a unique, personal, and dynamic style. Here are paintings from children's books (including the folktale Billy Goats Gruff), from various science fiction and fantasy novels, from gallery shows, from the Tolkien calendar--and of course, the unforgettable Star Wars poster in various stages of production. 160 pages (all in color), 9 1/2 x 12. REISSUE <br></p><p></p><h2>A Very Special House</h2><p>Continuing a two-year program to bring back twenty-two Maurice Sendak treasures long out of print, our second season of publication highlights one of the most successful author-illustrator pairings of all time. A pioneer of great children&#39;s literature, Ruth Krausspublished more than thirty books for children during a career that spanned forty years. Krauss and Sendak collaborated on eight books, and we are delighted to reintroduce four of these gems in brand-new editions, together with a favorite Maurice Sendak picture book.</p><p><p>Ruth Krauss (1901-1993) is the author of over thirty books for children, including the classics <em>The Carrot Seed</em>, illustrated by her husband, Crockett Johnson, and <em>A Hole Is to Dig</em>, illustrated by Maurice Sendak. "Ruth Krauss's intuitive ability as a writer to capture the free-spirited thought processes and laughter of young children ensures her books' widespread acceptance and timeless appeal." So concludes her entry in children's <em>Books and Their Creators</em> (1995).</p><br><br><p>In addition to <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>, Maurice Sendak's books include <em>Kenny's Window</em>, <em>Very Far Away</em>, <em>The Sign on Rosie's Door</em>, <em>Nutshell Library</em> (consisting of <em>Chicken Soup with Rice</em>, <em>Alligators All Around</em>, <em>One Was Johnny</em>, and <em>Pierre</em>), <em>Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More to Life</em>, <em>In the Night Kitchen</em>, <em>Outside Over There</em>, <em>We Are All in the Dumps with Jack and Guy</em>, and <em>Bumble-Ardy</em>.</p><p>He received the 1964 Caldecott Medal for <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>; the 1970 Hans Christian Andersen Award for Illustration; the 1983 Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, given by the American Library Association in recognition of his entire body of work; and a 1996 National Medal of Arts in recognition of his contribution to the arts in America. In 2003, he received the first Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award, an international prize for children's literature established by the Swedish government.</p>Now in its second season, HarperCollins's reissue of 22 Sendak classics continues. This time, his collaborations with Ruth Krauss take center stage. In Charlotte and the White Horse, first published in 1955, creamy pages frame Sendak's softly lit illustrations of a girl who convinces her father to keep a wobbly legged horse and cares for him until he can stand on his own. Sendak's delicate watercolors suit the dream-like mood of a boy who accomplishes all that he sets out to do in his imaginary world, in I Want to Paint My Bathroom Blue (1956), also by Krauss. A boy's imagination also comes to the fore in A Very Special House (1953) by Krauss, as the artist depicts the hero creating a home filled with a turtle, a giant, a very old lion and "some monkeys and some skunkeys." Oversize pages brim with the creatures as well as his house's "very special" furnishings. Open House for Butterflies (1960) takes a similar format to these collaborators' classic A Hole Is to Dig, and lastly, Hector Protector and As I Went Over the Water: Two Nursery Rhymes (1965) by Sendak conveys as much plot through the artist's wordless spreads as with the minimal text. For collectors and budding readers alike.

But in 1649 Parliament was hard put to find a lawyer with the skill and daring to prosecute a King who claimed to be above the law: in the end the man they briefed was the radical lawyer John Cooke. His Puritan conscience, political vision, and love of civil liberties gave him the courage to bring the King&#x2019;s trial to its dramatic conclusion: the English Republic. He would pay dearly for it: Charles I was beheaded, but eleven years later Cooke himself was arrested, tried, and brutally executed at the hands of Charles II.<br><br>Geoffrey Robertson, an internationally renowned human rights lawyer, provides a vivid new reading of the tumultuous Civil War years, exposing long-hidden truths: that the King was guilty as charged, that his execution was necessary to establish the sovereignty of Parliament, that the regicide trials were rigged and their victims should be seen as national heroes.<br><br>John Cooke sacrificed his own life to make tyranny a crime. His trial of Charles I, the first trial of a head of state for waging war on his own people, became a forerunner of the trials of Augusto Pinochet, Slobodan Milosevic, and Saddam Hussein. This is a superb work of history that casts a revelatory light on some of the most important issues of our time.</p><p>Geoffrey Robertson is a leading human rights lawyer and a UN war-crimes judge who has won landmark rulings on civil liberties from the highest courts in Britain, Europe, and the British Commonwealth. He was involved in the cases against General Pinochet and Hastings Banda and in the training of judges for the trial of Saddam Hussein. Robertson is the author of <i>Crimes Against Humanity</i>, which has been an inspiration for the global justice movement. Born in Australia, he now lives in London.The first recorded existence of John Cooke is in the register of All Saints church in the village of Husbands Bosworth, just south of Leicester. Here he was baptised on 18 September 1608, an indication that his birth had taken place a few days before. He came from poor but healthy farming stock: his father, Isaac Cooke, was twenty-five, and would live until the age of seventy-four. Isaac was one of twelve children of Abraham Cooke, who would die in 1620 at a similar age. If John could come through his early years, in this period when a third of all infants died before reaching five, he could be expected to live through all the seven ages of man predicted by Shakespeare, at this time writing his final plays for the London theatre. His family were God-fearing farmers, with allotments that dotted the countryside for twenty miles to the town of Burbage. Husbands Bosworth was named for all its husbandmen &#x2013; tenant farmers whose smallholdings sustained their families but little else &#x2013; and that would have been his parents&#x2019; expectation for baby John. What mattered most to Isaac and Elizabeth was that he would live an abstemious and pious life, his ability to do so being regarded as an outward sign that he was one of the &#x2018;elect&#x2019; predestined for paradise when the Son of God returned to claim the earth. <br><br>This mattered so much to these Puritan parents that for the baptism of their first-born they had travelled from their own farm, just outside Burbage, where the rector was a well-connected Anglican who obeyed the bishop, to Elizabeth&#x2019;s austere family church. Its minister was willing to dispense with &#x2018;impure&#x2019; rituals, like motioning the sign of the cross over the head of the baptised infant. That such a tiny gesture could become a major bone of contention between the bishops of the Church of England, who were sticklers for rituals and symbols, and those Puritan worshippers who wished to &#x2018;purify&#x2019; the Church of all such distractions, was typical of the internecine squabbling that had rent the Anglican religion. Puritans like the Cookes were thick on the ground in the Midlands and the eastern counties and many local ministers were sympathetic to their preference for deritualised worship, which was anathema to King James and his bishops. <br><br>James I had been invited from Scotland (where he ruled as James VI) to take the English throne on Elizabeth I&#x2019;s death in 1603. The optimism among Puritans in England that a man from the austere Calvinist Kirk would look sympathetically on their similar form of worship had soon been dashed: James was obsessed with his God-given right to rule as an absolute prince, through a hierarchy supported by archbishops and bishops, alongside his councillors and favourite courtiers. From the outset of his reign he urged the Anglican authorities to discipline ministers who refused to follow approved rituals or who spoke on politics from the pulpit. James I was very far from being &#x2018;the wisest fool in Christendom&#x2019;: he was highly educated and very canny, and he knew exactly where the Puritans&#x2019; hostility to hierarchy in their church would lead: &#x2018;no Bishop, no King&#x2019;. <br><br>James warned his son to &#x2018;hate no man more than a proud Puritan&#x2019;. He did not persecute them, but encouraged the Church to discriminate against them and to sack their ministers. The King&#x2019;s edicts, on matters of Sunday observance in particular, were often at variance with the strict moral code of these godly communities, and the profligacy and debauchery of his court further outraged them. As John Cooke grew up, there was much prurient gossip amongst the faithful about a monarch who claimed divine authority yet who maintained a luxurious and licentious court, financed by selling titles and monopolies, and who boasted that his favourite pastimes were &#x2018;hunting witches, prophets, Puritans, dead cats and hares&#x2019;. After all, James had a grotesque parentage: his mother was Mary, Queen of Scots. He was&nbsp; in her swollen belly when it was clutched at by her lover, David Riccio,&nbsp; as he was being dragged to his death at Holyrood House by a team of assassins led by James&#x2019;s father, Henry Stuart. Mary had later arranged for Henry to be strangled and had eventually been executed for plotting to kill her cousin and sister-queen Elizabeth I. If there was anything in the theory of hereditary right by which James acceded to the throne, it did not bode&nbsp;well for the Stuarts. <br><br>The farming community where the Cookes lived was small &#x2013; there were only seventy families at Burbage (then named Burbach) and a handful in their hamlet of Sketchley. The town&#x2019;s name &#x2013; a construct from &#x2018;burr&#x2019; (a kind of thistle) and &#x2018;bach&#x2019; (a rivulet) &#x2013; indicates the kind of countryside in which he played as a boy, although play was not encouraged by Puritans: they had been outraged when James issued a &#x2018;Book of Sports&#x2019;, permitting certain recreations after church on Sundays. As a young man, Cooke was well aware that the brand of religion on which he was raised was not in government favour. At school, where he excelled, he belonged to a group of Puritan children ostracised in the playground just as their parents were often excluded from worship in the church. There was one faith that suffered worse discrimination: the stateliest house in the area, Bosworth Hall, was owned by a Catholic family related to Sir Thomas More, and their secret celebration of Mass was the cause of occasional raids authorised by the local Justices of the Peace. Especially after the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, Catholics were regarded as potential terrorists, but the strength of their faith intrigued the boy, and would later tempt him to explore it before settling on his own. He spent long hours learning the Bible (the King James edition was printed in 1611, and widely distributed) and was brought up to believe that powerful men who had failed God&#x2019;s election were abandoned to sin &#x2013; a belief readily corroborated by reports of corrupt behaviour at court. <br><br>James, more homoerotically fixated as he became older, elevated his young male favourites (first Robert Carr, then George Villiers) to titles and positions of power entirely beyond their abilities. Scandalous rumours were rife throughout Cooke&#x2019;s youth, confirmed by trials in 1616 which gripped the nation. The Countess of Essex, married to Robert Carr whom the King had made Earl of Somerset, arranged for Sir Thomas Overbury to be murdered, by having arsenic put in his food and then, when that failed, by administration of an enema filled with poison. Various of the poisoners were convicted and hanged, but not the earl or the courtiers who had procured the murder, who were pardoned because of their status. Puritans got the message: although their birth might be low on the social scale, in death God would raise them far above kings and courtiers. Another message &#x2013; that there was no justice to be had in the King&#x2019;s courts, at least in cases concerning the King and his favourites &#x2013; would soon concern a new generation of lawyers for whom the common law of England, rooted in Magna Carta, brooked no such exceptions. <br><br>Another telling event of Cooke&#x2019;s youth was the execution in 1618 of Sir Walter Ralegh, that great Renaissance Englishman &#x2013; historian, explorer, poet, philosopher, intellectual and adventurer. He had been convicted in 1603 on trumped-up charges of plotting with Spanish interests to overthrow the newly crowned King James. His treason trial had been notable for the invective of the prosecutor, the ambitious Attorney-General Edward Coke: <br><br>Coke:&nbsp;You are the most vile and execrable traitor that ever lived. <br><br>Ralegh:&nbsp;You speak indiscreetly, uncivilly and barbarously. <br><br>Coke:&nbsp;I want words sufficient to express your viperous treasons. <br><br>Ralegh: I think you want words indeed, for you have spoken one thing half a dozen times. <br><br>Coke:&nbsp;You are an odious fellow; your name is hateful to all the realm of England . . . I will make it appear to the world that there never lived a viler viper on the face of the earth than you. <br><br>This abuse of the defendant was what passed for cross-examination in treason trials, after which jurors who had been hand-picked by the King&#x2019;s officials were expected to convict. This time, unusually, Coke&#x2019;s venom backfired: Ralegh&#x2019;s dignity earned him such popular support that James, cautious at the outset of his reign, felt it politic to suspend his death sentence. Sir Walter lived in modest comfort in the Tower of London, in rooms that can still be viewed, and was released in 1616 to mount an expedition in search of Spanish gold. It was unsuccessful, but it rekindled Spain&#x2019;s hatred of the man who had sunk so many of its galleons and had razed Cadiz. His execution was demanded as a condition of fulfilling James&#x2019;s pet project of marriage between his own heir (Charles) and the Spanish princess. James could hardly put Ralegh on public trial for attacking England&#x2019;s traditional enemy: instead, he ordered his Chancellor, the brilliant but bent Francis Bacon, to arrange to have the 1603 death sentence put into effect. Ralegh went to his long-delayed execution with memorable dignity, after a scaffold speech which persuaded everyone of his innocence and which convinced two of the onlookers &#x2013; the MPs John Eliot and John Pym &#x2013; that the Stuarts could not be trusted to govern the country. James was depraved, unpopular and idle: now he had killed an English hero at the request of Spain. There remained a general belief that he had been appointed by God, but by the end of his reign it had occurred to many MPs to examine more closely the terms of that divine appointment. <br><br>James had only one male heir, the small (5 feet 4 inches), stammering and petulant Charles, born in 1600. He was made Prince of Wales in 1616, after the death of Henry, his more popular elder brother.

It was the hunter-adventurer's paradise, and by the early 20th century, a small, lionhearted clan of explorers and big-game hunters began leading safaris there for money. They became the legendary White Hunters of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, men who led manifold adventurers--including royalty, film stars, writers, and millionaires--in pursuit of the world's biggest, most dangerous, and most sought-after game.<p> <i>White Hunters</i> is a nostalgic and densely-packed history of these men and their adventures, from the turn of the century until the 1970s when politics, a growing population, civil strife, and concern about species destruction intervened. Brian Herne has written a virtual and anecdotal Who's Who of White Hunters, crammed with the details of hundreds of hunts and the dozens of men who led them. </p><p>This is no book for the faint-hearted or the politically correct. Despite Herne's insistence that his heroes were the first true conservationists, <i>White Hunters</i> is all about the testosterone-enhanced glory of killing big, beautiful things: "Clary fired, dropping his quarry with a side brain shot. The record-class tusks weighed 159 and 143 pounds each, a gigantic elephant...." On the other hand, a staggering number of hunters died in pursuit of their quarry--mauled, eviscerated, or impaled on the tusks of furious, vengeful beasts.</p><p> Not so long ago lions wandered the streets of Nairobi. The politics of big-game hunting aside, the White Hunters' East Africa--wild, mysterious, unspoiled--is vanishing, and Herne has painstakingly documented an era that most readers will likely never know. <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p>The founder of the international professional hunters&#39; magazine Track, Brian Herne has written for numerous magazines including Outdoor Life, Petersen&#39;s Hunting, Safari Times, and African Life.

But beneath the uneasy surface of the freakishly memorable landscapes depicted in this original collection lies the familiar trappings of adolescence: strip malls and cul-de-sacs, stifling suburbs, teenage crushes and rebellions, absent parents, and a frightening, unpromising future. <p> In "Teen Sniper," a lonely 15-year-old LAPD marksman, whose only friend is ROMS, the squad's bomb-detecting robot, can snuff out a life in a heartbeat from 475 meters away yet can't connect with the girl of his dreams standing right in front of his nose. In this unsettling story, the sniper visualizes the impact wounds of his victims--renegade employees of Silicon Valley software companies--as beautiful floral imagery. </p><blockquote><i>Duck, you fool</i>, I can't help whispering.</blockquote> <blockquote>The slug goes, connects--a neck shot, my trademark, the wound lapping like the tongues of orchid petals. The target's knees go out, and he falls from view, dropping into the beige of his cubicle.</blockquote> A real standout in this powerful collection is "Your Own Backyard." A former police officer turned rent-a-cop works the night shift at a Phoenix zoo, where he has the undesirable job of eliminating the unwanted animals ("young ones, old ones, sick ones, extra ones"). Yellow Post-it notes stuck to the guard shack serve as death sentences, his assignments for the night. This troubled father views his unpredictable young son's increased fascination with violence as the all-too-familiar shadow of a criminal mind in the making. "Trauma Plate" features a teenager acting out against her parents--who run a bulletproof-vest rental shop in a deserted strip mall--by daring her crush to take a shot at her Kevlar covered heart; a Louisiana family counts down the hours until the ATF slams into their home in the atmospheric "The Jughead of Berlin"; and in "The Death-Dealing Cassini Satellite," a 19-year-old slacker occupies his time by driving a party bus filled with the members of his late mother's cancer support group. Despite the unusually edgy nature of the stories, at its core, <i>Emporium</i> is surprisingly moving--its characters aching to connect in an ominous, uncertain world. Keep Adam Johnson on your literary radar; <i>Emporium</i> is a searing debut from a writer to watch. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i>Adam Johnson is currently a Jones Lecturer at Stanford University.

Dole&#39;s easy-to-read translation from the original Latin makes Swedenborg&#39;s experiences accessible to all. Swedenborg describes heaven, the world of spirits, and hell, and explains their meaning and relationship to our lives in the material world. Well-delineated chapters help readers explore their questions. They will find reasons for hope, and a better understanding of why choices in this life affect their realities in the next.</p><p><p>Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) was a Swedish scientist, nobleman, and theologian who spent his life investigating the mysteries of the soul. Born in Stockholm to a staunchly Lutheran family, he graduated from the University of Uppsala and then traveled to England, Holland, France, and Germany to study the leading scientists of the time. He gained favor with Sweden&#x2019;s King Charles XII, who gave him the position of overseer of the Swedish mining industry. Later, he was given a seat on the Swedish House of Nobles by Charles XII&#x2019;s successor, Queen Ulrika Eleonora. Between 1743 and 1745 he began to have visions of heaven, hell, and Jesus Christ which resulted in a stream of books about the nature of God, the afterlife, and the inner meaning of the Bible. He devoted the last decades of his life to studying Scripture and presenting his own unique theology to the world.</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Some people believe it is hard to lead the heaven-bound life that is called &#x2018;spiritual&#x2019; because they have heard that we need to renounce the world and give up the desires attributed to the body and the flesh and &#x2018;live spiritually.&#x2019; All they understand by this is spurning worldly interests, especially concerns for money and prestige, going around in constant devout meditation about God, salvation, and eternal life, devoting their lives to prayer, and reading the Word and religious literature. They think this is renouncing the world and living for the spirit and not for the flesh. However, the actual case is quite different, as I have learned from an abundant experience and conversation with angels. In fact, people who renounce the world and live for the spirit in this fashion take on a mournful life for themselves, a life that is not open to heavenly joy, since our life does remain with us [after death]. No, if we would accept heaven&#x2019;s life, we need by all means to live in the world and to participate in its duties and affairs. In this way, we accept a spiritual life by means of our moral and civic life; and there is no other way a spiritual life can be formed within us, no other way our spirits can be prepared for heaven. This is because living an inner life and not an outer life at the same time is like living in a house that has no foundation, that gradually either settles or develops gaping cracks or totters until it collapses.&#x201d;</p><p></p></p><h2>Junie B.

While there, his reporter&#x2019;s curiosity was engaged by a bitter dispute raging between the Paiutes and non-Indian squatters who were claiming the most agriculturally productive lands of the reservation and the waters feeding the lake that was the economic and spiritual heart of the Paiutes&#x2019; ancient culture.<p>Liebling recorded the litigation over the fate of the Pyramid Lake Reservation lands in a series of articles published in&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>&nbsp;in 1955.

This new volume from Roger Housden features a few of the same poets as his extraordinarily moving Ten Poems to Change Your Life, such as Mary Oliver and Pablo Neruda, along with contributions from Sharon Olds, Wislawa Szymborska, Czeslaw Milosz, Denise Levertov, and others. Any one of the ten poems and, indeed, any one of Housden&#x2019;s reflections on them, can open, gladden, or pierce your heart. <br><br>Through the voices of these ten inspiring poets, and through illustrations from his own life, Housden expresses the tenderness, beauty, joys, and sorrows of love, the presence of which, more than anything else, gives human existence its meaning.<br><br>As Housden says in his eloquent introduction, &#x201c;Great poetry happens when the mind is looking the other way and words fall from the sky to shape a moment that would normally be untranslatable. . . .

Without fanfare, without embarrassment, without any doubt, I talk directly to your soul. Listen to me. Lift the oars from the water, let your arms rest, and your heart, and heart's little intelligence, and listen to me. There is life without love. It is not worth a bent penny, or a scuffed shoe. It is not worth the body of a dead dog nine days unburied. When you hear, a mile away and still out of sight, the churn of the water as it begins to swirl and roil, fretting around the sharp rocks--when you hear that unmistakable pounding--when you feel the mist on your mouth and sense ahead the embattlement, the long falls plunging and steaming--then row, row for your life toward it.<br><br>ROW FOR YOUR LIFE<br><br>"Poetry is a life-cherishing force. For poems are not words, after all, but fires for the cold, ropes let down to the lost, something as necessary as bread in the pockets of the hungry. Yes indeed."<br><br>Mary Oliver, A Poetry Handbook<br><br>Yes indeed! I can still feel the heat of Mary Oliver's poem long after I have put it down. It is a prose poem, and one of the most deeply passionate poems on love that I have ever read. Mary Oliver is speaking directly to the way we live. The love in question is of the kind that feeds the whole garden of a life. What does it feel like to live a life of love? What does it take; and what is the alternative? These are the questions that burn through this poem.<br><br>Oliver, one of the most lyrical poets alive today, speaks plainly here; she has chosen to convey her message in prose. Her choice fits the poem's plain and declarative style. When I read this poem, however, I feel it is not so much she who makes these declarations, as that part of me who recognizes the truth of them. To read this poem aloud is to have the wiser part of yourself counsel the younger, untested heart that lives in us all.<br><br>You are young. So you know everything. You leap into the boat and begin rowing.<br><br>Even now, at the age of fifty-seven, and for all the experience that has tried to teach me otherwise, there is a part of me, still young, that is tempted to leap into the boat and start rowing. I can still act as if I know everything. I can pile into an idea or a course of action before I have barely given it the time of day, with what can seem like an arrogant certainty. This is what Oliver calls "the heart's little intelligence": the impulsive response of a heart governed by the emotion of the moment.<br><br>In that moment, however, full of the rush of my own sense of capability, I feel as if I am getting on with the task at hand. Action is needed, and I'm taking it. Perhaps it's in my hard wiring: most men feel good when they fix things. Sometimes too late, it dawns on me how such "effectiveness" can rip at the fabric of things and discount the filaments of connection that join any one life to another.<br><br>But listen to me. Without fanfare, without embarrassment, without any doubt, I talk directly to your soul.<br><br>"Listen to me": Oliver calls out three times. It is always three times that the cock crows. She calls, not to the youth in us, not to the impulsive heart that knows and sees the world with a naive and definite clarity; she speaks to our soul. The soul knows in a different way. It gathers honey in the dark from near and far. The soul is always connected to a larger life. It is joined by invisible threads to the soul of all other things, and in this way, the world whispers to it without ceasing. That is why it is natural for the soul to pause, to listen, to wonder. Only the soul in us has the time to listen deeply.<br><br>If this poem is full of words consonant with sound--"the churn of the water...that unmistakable pounding...the long falls plunging and steaming"--it is because of this: that Oliver is addressing that part of us which is willing to listen in the dark, and willing to know with a knowing that is more of a shiver than a string of bright words.<br><br>There is life without love.<br><br>Mary Oliver is speaking directly to that part of you and me that knows, however faintly, that when we rush into life, when we leap into action without any connection to the deeper currents that move through us always, we are acting without love. Our oars thrash at the water, and we break the gossamer web of life this way.<br><br>There is indeed a life without love, she says. It is quite possible to live a life in which your soul plays no part. You can jump up and down with every passing impulse, and never hear the whispering call that is there all along. On the other hand, you can live a busy, efficient existence full of duties and responsibilities and never even know there is a deeper life. You can be successful, a bright star, even. But your nights may carry other voices on the wings of dreams. Whispers of great empty spaces, lonely and afraid.<br><br>Life without love--without the soul being wholly engaged in your living--is not worth a bent penny. Not just a penny, but a bent penny. Not just a single shoe, which is worthless without its partner, but a scuffed shoe. The bent penny and the scuffed shoe are degraded, somehow; their original form has been bent out of shape. Then, not just a dead dog, but a dead dog nine days unburied. Life without love stinks. These are some of the most shocking, awakening images I know of. Oliver is entirely uncompromising here; fierce, even. She does not fudge. If you will give no room for the soul in your life, then you might as well give up on the game now.<br><br>This is why she is calling so urgently here, not to the untested heart that jumps with every passing emotion, but to the truth of your deep heart. Every spiritual tradition makes a distinction between the two. The Christians call the latter the interior heart; the Hindus, the heart within the heart. The soul is its other name.<br><br>Mary Oliver is calling to your soul. It is a call you will find echoing through all her work. Mary Oliver, Pulitzer prize-winner, winner of the National Book Award, is one of the few great voices in American literature today who urges us to love this world with astonishment and devotion. "You do not have to be good," she declares (in her poem "Wild Geese"2); to Be, and to be awake--that, her poetry sings out, is the holiest thing.<br><br>Your soul, she suggests, is already connected to the bigger life that joins you to everything else. Let us call that bigger life by its true name, which is love. Mary Oliver is speaking not only of the love for another here, though that may be one way your own soul travels, as mine has. She is speaking more broadly about your life as a whole: whether its overall movement is one of love, or one of alienation.<br><br>When you hear that call, she says, when you feel in your marrow the pull of your soul--to another human being, to a work, to the true direction of your life--that is the time to act. Without that inner prompting, which you can hear only when you lay down your oars and listen in the quiet; without that, you will be like a boat without a rudder in life, however much control you may appear to have. Even though the source of the magnetic pull is still out of sight, even though you can't possibly know where it will lead you, though it may seem to be beyond all reason--to be madness, even--you must respond to it.<br><br>Trust and courage are qualities of soul, and you will need them both to follow the path of love. Which doesn't mean you won't feel trepidation, dread, even. But your fear and anxiety will be held in the broad embrace of a deeper trust whose source is love itself, the soul's air.<br><br>the churn of the water as it begins to swirl and roil, fretting around the sharp rocks--<br><br>I first experienced the wildness of love when I was thirty years old. It was no easy ride, and my heart was pounding. Never before then had I fallen in love so completely, without reserve. It happened all of a sudden, with someone I had known well for years. One evening we were sitting with others in a room in London, as we had done so many times before. Our gaze met, and in that moment, a bolt of lightning passed between us. The intensity was so great, so unexpected, that I had to look away. The shock was too much to bear. From that moment on, we both felt as if the other was intimately present with us, day and night, wherever we were. From then on, whenever our eyes met, our bodies and minds were filled with the presence of an intense aliveness.<br><br>This woman, however, was the wife of one of my best friends and colleagues. I, too, was married, and my wife was pregnant. An old, old story, in which there is no lack of swirling and roiling. But was it love, or was it infatuation? Was it the call of the soul or the impulse of the untried heart, which had never known such wild intensity before? It is not always easy to know the difference, especially when the certainty of the young, impulsive part of us can be so convincing.<br><br>Webster's dictionary says infatuation is "to be inspired with a foolish or extravagant love." That certainly fits the description, though who is to say after the event if any love is foolish? The longing we had to be in each other's presence could not possibly be denied; yet to act on it decisively would have caused deep suffering for both our partners and our children. In the event, our lives led us away from each other within a few months, and what seemed at the time like the more difficult road, the call of duty--though now I sense it to have been the wisdom of some deeper stream--won out. Our partners still suffered, of course, and as it happened, years later, both marriages ended.<br><br>After those few brief months I did not see or hear of the woman whose eyes I had seen across that room for another twenty years. When we did finally meet again, on another continent, we still carried the memory of those fiery times, and realized that we continued to see each other in its reflection. Yet the intensity had died down long before, and our lives had moved on. There was no going back, and there were no regrets. Only a certain astonishment at how a love never dies, even so; and at the way life had picked us up, whirled us around, and set us down again on a path quite different from the one we had briefly imagined might be our destiny.<br><br>You will interpret Mary Oliver's words according to your own life circumstance. Only you, in a quiet moment of receptivity, can know the difference between your soul's true direction and the convincing clamor of your life's current intensity. Wherever you are in your life, her lines call out to you to let yourself fall headlong into the life that has been waiting for you all along. And whatever the circumstance, if it is a matter of love, it will be the ride of your life.<br><br>Not only that: it may well be the death of you--of the you that has refused to listen for so long, who has dared live only in a corner of your life, rather than reach out and bite the full fruit of it. When you hear the sound of that deep current, Mary Oliver says--"that unmistakable pounding"--then row! Think about it--she is urging us to head for the almighty drop, sight unseen, "a mile / away and still out of sight,..."<br><br>"[R]ow for your life / toward it." When you row, you have your back facing the direction you are heading toward. Even in this final moment, in this last line, Mary Oliver is saying it again: you cannot hope to see what lies ahead when it comes to a life lived with love. You can only row, drawn on by the soundless sound, knowing there is nothing else you can do or would even want to do.<br><br>What an astounding call. To strike out into the current that was there all along, rather than try so hard to push this way and that by your own efforts; to row along with it and sail over the waterfall into the bright air of love. Only much later in my life did I come to have that experience. Fully committed, not even having to know fully to what.<br><br>NOTE<br><br>1. Excerpt from A Poetry Handbook. Mary Oliver. New York: Harvest Books, 1995.</p><h2>City of the Century: The Epic of Chicago and the Making of America</h2><p>A compelling chronicle of the coming of the Industrial Age to one American city traces the explosive entrepreneurial, technological, and artistic growth that converted Chicago from a trading post to a modern industrial metropolis by the 1890s.</p><p>Donald L. Miller is the John Henry McCracken Professor of History at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.A picaresque biography of a picaresque city; a thick tome that, despite its weight, one puts down with reluctance. Miller (History/Lafayette College; Lewis Mumford: A Life, 1989) begins in 1673, with Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet, the first Europeans to explore the site. But the true focus of the narrative is the 19th century, following Chicago's explosive growth from a small fort in 1803 to a sprawling city of more than a million people 90 years later. The climax of the book is Chicago's 1893 Columbia Exposition, an almost unimaginably opulent, massive display of American achievement. It was appropriate that this world's fair commemorating 400 years of American development should be hosted by Chicago, writes Miller, who embraces the common thesis that 19th-century Chicago was the most American of American cities: ``the epic of Chicago is the story of the emergence of modern America.'' But Miller takes the argument one step further, asserting that Chicago differed from the rest of the country because it took the most significant trends shaping America to their extremes, for better and for worse. Nowhere else was unbridled capitalism given such free reign. Nowhere else was there a location so ideally suited to the production of wealth and the emergence of ``the most compelling of all creations of the 19th century, the wildly expanding industrial metropolis, city of smoke and steel and sweat.'' Miller describes Chicago as a ``living drama'' peopled by colorful, complex characters: industrial and merchandising geniuses who created jobs but exploited and denigrated their workers, for example; or the corrupt politicians who nonetheless also gave much to their constituents. Miller argues that Chicago illuminates our era as well. Capitalism's pluses and minuses, the influence of the city, the responsibilities and limitations of government, the ferment that generates artistic creativity, and other very modern issues are made clearer by this epic history. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Withheld for almost a lifetime, it is a tragic story of a woman's trial of surviving against brutal odds.<br>Near the end of her life Mary Hamilton (1866-c.1936) was urged to record this astonishing narrative. It is the only known first-hand account by an ordinary woman depicting the extraordinary routines demanded in this time and this place. She reveals the unbelievably arduous role a woman played in the taming of the Delta wilderness, a position marked by unspeakably harsh, bone-breaking toil.<br>On a raw November day in 1932 Helen Dick Davis entered a backwoods cabin in the Delta and encountered Mary Hamilton, a tiny, hunchbacked old woman sitting by the fire and patching a pair of hunting trousers. They became friends.<br>"She began to talk to me of her life nearly half a century ago in this same Mississippi Delta," Davis says, "which then was a wilderness of untouched timber, canebrakes, a jungle of briars and vines and undergrowth." Spellbound during her visits to the cabin, Davis would listen for hours. At her request, Mary Hamilton began to record memories on scraps of paper. By the spring of 1933 she had given Davis a manuscript of 150,000 words, "the true happenings of my life."<br>Married to a mysterious Englishman, she lived in crude shacks and tents in lumber camps and cooked for crews clearing the primeval Delta forests. While nursing the sick, burying the dead, and making failing attempts to provide a home for her children, she retained a gentle strength that expressed itself in a lyrical vision of nature and in mystical dreams.<br>When Helen Dick Davis appeared to Mary Hamilton in her old age, this long-delayed memoir of pain and grace erupted in a narrative of beauty and compassion and preserved a time and a place never before recorded from such a view.<br>Mary Hamilton's autobiography is published at long last after coming to light from Helen Dick Davis's trunk of mementos.</p><p>This remarkable memoir owes its existence to the indefatigable Davis ( Shim ), who met the elderly Mary Hamilton in 1931 and encouraged her to set down her recollections of life in the Mississippi Delta backwoods during the latter part of the 19th century. Rejected by Little, Brown in 1933, the manuscript, edited by Davis from Hamilton's handwritten original, resurfaced in 1991; Davis copy-edited it and approved its publication before her recent death. The unlettered yet vividly expressive Hamilton writes graphically of her arduous work, deep sorrows and exalting joys. She begins her account in Arkansas in the early 1880s, when the teenage Mary met and married Frank Hamilton, an Englishman who was manager of a lumber camp charged with clearing the forests of the Delta. Her straightforward narrative details cooking for large groups of lumberjacks, childrens' births and deaths, impermanent homes in camps and farms, loneliness, natural disasters and her husband's death in 1914. The book includes holograph pages from the original manuscript and a preface by Davis. A unique autobiography of a Southern pioneer woman. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.To read Hamilton's autobiography is to experience an extraordinary life of courage and hardship. Born in 1867 and married at age 18 to a man 12 years her senior, Hamilton found herself raising (and, sadly, burying) children in a variety of Mississippi delta farms and boarding houses. In addition to hardship, her life was tinged with mystery; her husband, Frank, came from an upper-class English family but refused to speak of his past or allow his children to claim their possible foreign inheritance. Hamilton, a born storyteller, has written a rich, simple narrative; her personal strength is surpassed only by the strength of her writing abilities. This work ranks with Martha Summerhayes's Vanished Arizona (1911). Originally turned down by a publisher in 1933, Trials of the Earth is long overdue in its chance to win readers and tell of a time long gone.<br><i>- Katherine Gillen, Mesa P.L., Ariz.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sacred Gifts and Worldly Treasure: Medieval Masterworks from the Cleveland Museum of Art</h2><p>pp. 319, full page color illustrations of rthe art works, as new.</p><p></p><h2>The One Year Book of Encouragement: 365 Days of Inspiration and Wisdom for Your Spiritual Journey</h2><p><i>The One Year Book of Encouragement</i> is a collection of insights from assorted Christian authors, past and present&#x2015;from Oswald Chambers and Philip Yancey to John Calvin and John Wesley.

Many of the finer points are dealt with. You know the head is ruled by Aries, but did you know the nasal bones are co-ruled by Scorpio? There are references to Vedic principles. A helpful diagram explains the subtle division of the urinary tract between Libra and Scorpio. Rulerships are given not only for areas of the body and its organs, but also for bones, muscles, arteries and veins. Terminology in the book is modern. Gemini's rulership of muscles includes the deltoid, biceps, supinator radii, subclavians, triceps, serratus anticus minor, pectoralis, palmaris, etc. <p> Many chapters are unique, such as Chapter 5, on crystallization, and Chapter 6, on tonicity, atonicity, and perversion. This chapter also tells how pairs of planets mirror each other: Sun/Moon, Mars/Saturn, Jupiter/Venus, Uranus/Neptune, with Mercury as a receiver. Chapter 11 concerns many different kinds of planetary strengths, among them, aspect strength, mundane strength, natural strength (the planet in its natal sign) and directional strength.

She knew me well enough to know I wouldn't try to catch it, either.</p> <p>"Come keep me company," she said, and drew me firmly to one side of all the colorful commotion. "I need to sit."</p> <p>My father's wild Aunt Lucy, nearly lost in layered flounces of bronze taffeta, tried once to herd us back as we went past. "Oh, girls, you mustn't run away. Go on, get in there. Have a go." Smiling at my cousin, she said, "Third time lucky, Jacqueline, so they say. And Sara, dear," she added in a cheering tone, to me, "there's always hope."</p> <p>I might have pointed out there wasn't, really. Catching things had never been my strong suit, and it always seemed ridiculous to go through all that effort just to field a bunch of flowers that, while pretty, only showed which of the women at the wedding was the most determined to be married next, not which one would be.</p> <p>Jacqui didn't give me time to point out anything. She simply answered, "Yes, Aunt Lucy, thanks for that, but Sara isn't feeling well."</p> <p>And then she steered me off again.</p> <p>I looked at her. "I'm feeling fine."</p> <p>"I had to give her some excuse, or she'd have never let us be. You know the way she is. And I could hardly say I wasn't feeling well-she'd only think that I was pregnant."</p> <p>I had to admit that was true. Jacqui's love life-including her two short-lived marriages, one to a singer flamboyant enough to ensure their divorce had been given a place in the tabloids-was frequently a source of gossip at these family gatherings. She fueled that gossip on her own sometimes when she got bored, and had been known to start a rumor in one corner of the room to see how long it took to travel to another, but this evening she did not seem bored.</p> <p>I asked, because I couldn't see the man she'd come with, "Where did you leave Humphrey?"</p> <p>"Over there. He found the punch bowl, I'm afraid, before I had a chance to warn him. Drank three glasses of it."</p> <p>Uncle Gordon spiked the punch at every family wedding. No one knew with what, but even those of us who'd only ever heard about the hangovers knew better than to drink the stuff. "Poor Humphrey."</p> <p>Jacqui sighed. "Poor me, more like. I doubt he'll make it into work on Monday, and we've got a sales meeting. That's what I get," she said, "for bringing my assistant to a Thomas family wedding."</p> <p>I agreed she should have known better. I hadn't brought a date myself, but then I didn't have a Humphrey, clever and good-looking, sitting handily outside my office door. And no one here expected me to bring somebody, anyway.</p> <p>"Let's find a table," Jacqui said.</p> <p>We found one tucked quietly off in a corner, half-hidden by one of the faux-marble columns that held up the wedding hall's high ceiling, painted ethereal blue with winged cherubs. The whole setting was a bit over-the-top, but it suited our young cousin Daphne, whose wedding this was. Daphne lived and breathed drama, which made her quite fun in small doses but very exhausting in larger ones.</p> <p>"All a bit much?" Jacqui asked me. At first I assumed she was thinking, as I was, about the wedding, but then she asked, "How are you coping?" and I understood.</p> <p>She had always been something of my guardian angel, since I'd been put into her arms as a baby when she had been ten. She was, if one worked out the family tree, more properly my father's cousin, daughter of his youngest uncle, but that made her still my own first cousin once removed, and I had claimed her and was keeping her.</p> <p>It had been Jacqui who'd first noticed something was a little different in the way I saw the world, and through my childhood and my teens she'd been close by to show me what to do, like an interpreter to guide me through the labyrinth; to pick me up and dust me off if I stepped off the path and took a tumble. And the first year I had spent at university, that awful year when things had started coming all unglued for me, it had been Jacqui who had taken me to lunch with a new author, whose first book she had been editing.</p> <p>"He's a psychologist," she'd introduced him. "Brilliant book, just fascinating. All about these children who have-how do you pronounce it, Colin?"</p> <p>"Asperger's." He'd said it with a hard g, as in hamburgers.</p> <p>At Jacqui's prompting, he had talked all through our lunch about the syndrome that at that time was believed to lie midway along the sliding scale between the "normal" world and full-on autism, making those who had it all too miserably aware that they were different without understanding why, unable to read and interpret all the complex social cues most other people took for granted-tones of voice, and body language, and the strange figures of speech that made a person say that he had been "knocked sideways" when he hadn't moved at all.</p> <p>And I had known.</p> <p>It had, if I was honest, been a great relief to finally put a name to what the issue was. I'd gone for consultations later with that same psychologist, and with my cousin waiting just outside his office door, we'd done the proper tests. He had explained it very clearly, using terms I could relate to.</p> <p>"You're a programmer, aren't you?" he'd asked me. "You work with computers. Well, if you think of your own mind as a computer, which it is, then your basic architecture is different from most of the other computers around you. You're wired differently, you connect differently, and you run different software on a different operating system. You're like the lone Mac," he'd concluded, "in an office of PCs. They're all running Windows, and you're running OS X."</p> <p>That had helped. I'd been able to picture that one Mac computer alone on its desk with its own software, processing everything in its own way while all of the other computers, the PCs, shared their incompatible system.</p> <p>But Jacqui hadn't liked that image. "You don't want to be alone, off in your own corner," she had told me in decided tones. And having helped me put a name to what the problem was, she'd tackled it the way she tackled everything: head on. She'd bought me books and studied on her own, and with a single-minded focus Henry Higgins might have envied, she had tutored me in how to hide the signs, to pass for normal.</p> <p>"You just have to pretend," she'd said, choosing another analogy, "that you're an alien, come here to learn about earthlings. Our language, our customs, our idioms, all of that. Study and learn them, the way you would any strange culture. But you don't want to look like an alien, and that means learning to mimic. I'll show you."</p> <p>She'd shown me. Most days, I still felt like an alien, if I was honest. But Jacqui had done her job so well these past several years that my own parents, even when faced with the facts, still refused to believe I was anything more than a little bit quirky. And in a family like mine, I thought-bringing my mind firmly back to the present as new bursts of clapping amid shrieks of laughter announced that somebody had caught the bouquet-being quirky was hardly unusual.</p> <p>"How are you coping?" asked Jacqui again, and I shrugged.</p> <p>"I'm all right. I could have done without the DJ."</p> <p>"Yes, well, so could we all. It was too loud for me," she admitted, "so I can only imagine what it must have been like for you."</p> <p>My senses were...sensitive. Easily jangled and jarred. The wiring of my mind made sounds that other people could ignore strike at me with the full force of a whining dentist's drill. Strong lighting sometimes gave me headaches, certain fabrics rubbed as painfully as sandpaper against my skin, and when all that was added to a room packed full of people, interacting in a way I had to work to understand, then staying calm became a test of my endurance.</p> <p>Jacqui smiled and took a piece of paper from her handbag. "Here," she said, and slid the paper over to me. "This might help."</p> <p>Shaking my head, I assured her, "I'm not at that stage yet."</p> <p>"What stage?"</p> <p>"The Sudoku stage." Then, because she was still watching me with that expression I'd known from my childhood, I added more firmly, "I'm fine."</p> <p>I admittedly found it a little endearing that she'd always fed my addiction to numbers, in full understanding that, when I felt overwhelmed, nothing could calm me like complex equations or, lately, Sudoku-the neat, tidy patterns of numbers in squares, like a warm, fuzzy blanket that wrapped round my mind and was instantly soothing.</p> <p>It hadn't surprised me that Jacqui had noticed when I'd made the switch to Sudoku. There wasn't much Jacqui missed noticing. And for the past several months she had seemed to have one of the puzzles conveniently tucked in her handbag whenever I'd needed one. But...</p> <p>"You can stop looking after me," I told her. "Honestly. I'm a big girl now."</p> <p>"I know that." Her tone told me nothing, but I'd learned that whenever her mouth tightened down at the corners like that, she was being defensive. "And anyway, that's not a puzzle, exactly."</p> <p>I looked at the page. She was right. These were numbers, but not in an order I recognized-just numbers printed in pairs and threes, with dots between them:</p> <p>106.62.181.189.68.172.766.86.128.185.64.175.<br> 19.67.164.186.65.47.679.55.173.25.122.13.64.<br> 562.215.128.196.29.56.63</p> <p>I was already starting to look for the patterns when I asked, "What's this?"</p> <p>"It's a code. Codes were one of your things, weren't they?"</p> <p>"When I was ten, sure." I'd been in Year Six then. Our studies had taken us through World War II and the work of the code breakers at Bletchley Park, and I'd been so obsessed with cryptanalysis that, for the whole remainder of that winter, I had written all my school notes in a cipher of my own devising, much to the frustration of my teachers and my parents. "But that was almost twenty years ago."</p> <p>"Well, I'll lay odds you've not forgotten. That code," she said, with a nod towards the paper I was holding, "is an old one, from the early eighteenth century."</p> <p>It wasn't actually a code, I could have told her, but a cipher. More specifically, it seemed to be a substitution cipher, in which numbers had been used in place of letters of the alphabet. But I only asked, "And why do you have it?"</p> <p>"I got it from one of my authors. You've never met Alistair Scott, have you?"</p> <p>"Who?"</p> <p>"The historian, Alistair Scott. He's quite famous. He used to be on television all the time."</p> <p>I took her word for it. I didn't have a television. "And?" I smoothed the paper with my fingers as I focused on the numbers. There weren't many that were higher than 500, so I guessed those might be placeholders, to mark the ends of words.</p> <p>"He's working on a new book," she went on, "and there's a source he needs to use, but it's in code. He wants someone to break it for him. So I thought of you."</p> <p>"I'm hardly a professional."</p> <p>"You need the work."</p> <p>I paused, and faintly smiled. "I wondered how long it would take before you brought that up. Who told you?"</p> <p>"Need you ask?"</p> <p>My mother, then. I looked more closely at the numbers, noting the most common ones were in the 60s. Probably the e's, I thought. The letter used most frequently in English, after all, was e. It also was the letter we used most for ending words. If I was right about the placeholders, then two words in this cipher ended in 60-somethings, so again, they were most likely e's. I took a pencil from my handbag. "So she's told you all the details, has she?"</p> <p>"Only that you handed in your notice," Jacqui said. "You can't keep doing that."</p> <p>"They wouldn't let me work alone."</p> <p>"Most people in IT do work in teams."</p> <p>"I don't." And if the 60-somethings were all e's, that meant it was the 6 alone that mattered, and the final digit didn't count. Testing this, I tried removing all the final digits right across the board, from all the numbers, and put e's where all the sixes were, and spaces for the placeholders. I ended up with:</p> <p>10.e.18.18.e.17.space.8.12.18.e.17.1.e.16.18.e.4.<br> space.5.17.2.12.1.e.space.21.12.19.2.5.e</p> <p>There, I thought. Much less unwieldy. Right then. Twenty-six letters in the alphabet. Except if I were dealing with a simple substitution cipher, in which a was 1, and b was 2, and so on, then e would be written as 5 and not 6. I flipped e and f round, and got gibberish: Jerreq hlreqaepred fqblae ulsbfe.</p> <p>Jacqui told me, "It would mean a trip to Paris. You like Paris."</p> <p>"In December?"</p> <p>"Well, you wouldn't have to go till after Christmas."</p> <p>"Even worse."</p> <p>She held her silence for a moment, then she said, "You're right. You'd do much better staying here and moving back in with your parents. That would be a lot more fun."</p> <p>I wasn't always good at detecting sarcasm, but in this instance just the words alone were all I needed to be certain she was teasing. Glancing up, I tried to straighten out my smile. "Ha-ha."</p> <p>"No, really. And your mother could invite young men to lunch on Sundays. You could have a lovely time."</p> <p>"I won't need to move home," I said. "I've got three months left on my lease. I'll find another job."</p> <p>"This one would let you work alone. Besides, he pays obscenely well, you know, does Alistair."</p> <p>I shook my head. "I couldn't take his money." I flipped a few more letters, moving closer to an understanding of the patterns used by whoever had made this cipher. "This," I said, "is really pretty basic, not so difficult. I've nearly got it. When I've finished here, I'll let you have the key, and you can pass it on to him, and he can do all the deciphering himself, for nothing."</p> <p>"Yes, well, there's one problem with your logic," Jacqui told me.</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"The code you've got there," she informed me, "is not the one Alistair needs to have broken."</p> <p>My pencil paused, but only briefly, because I was too far along to just stop. "Then why do I have it?"</p> <p>"It's sort of a test. I told Alistair you were a wizard with codes and things, and he said if you cracked this one in under a week, he would not only hire you, he'd buy you a bottle of whisky."</p> <p>I wasn't sure what letter had been flipped with r. The first word, with its double r, was likely my best clue. It might be meant to be a double l, perhaps, or double t. Since t was the most common English consonant, I went with that. Jetteq, read the first word now, unhelpfully. "He knows what this says, then?"</p> <p>She nodded. "It's out of an old book, or something."</p> <p>I had only two bits of the cipher left to unravel.</p> <p>"Tell Alistair Scott," I said, "that if he's buying me whisky, my preference is sixteen-year-old Lagavulin." I jotted the translation down and rotated the paper to slide it back over the table towards her.</p> <p>I knew that I'd done it correctly when I saw her smile. That was how Jacqui always smiled when I did something to make her proud. "See? I was sure you could do it."</p> <p>"I'm not a real code breaker."</p> <p>"Sara." She held up the paper. "You solved this in seventeen minutes. You're good at it."</p> <p>Probably not good enough, said my inner perfectionist.</p> <p>Jacqui, who'd known me so long and so well that she likely could hear that voice, too, said, "Come with me tomorrow, I'll take you to meet him."</p> <p>"To Paris? Be serious."</p> <p>"Alistair Scott's not in Paris."</p> <p>"But you said-"</p> <p>"He only lives over the river, in Ham. It's the job that's in Paris."</p> <p>She asked me again to come meet him, and of course I told her yes, because I knew she wouldn't let it go until I gave the answer that she wanted. But my gaze stayed on the paper in her hand while we were talking, and I wondered who had written...</p></p><h2>Hitchcock, the first forty-four films (Ungar film library)</h2><p>Sir Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) - his name, his profile and his lugubrious voice - became a trademark for the psychological thrillers and suspense movies he pioneered to become the master of the macabre.

Beuys embraced radically democratic artistic and political ideas, proclaiming &#x201c;Everyone is an artist,&#x201d; and advocating direct democracy through referenda. He famously worked with such nontraditional materials as felt, fat, and plants and animals both alive and dead. Beuys and his work&#x2015;performance art, drawing, painting, sculpture, installation&#x2015;received perhaps the most contentious reception of any postwar artist. This reader brings together the crucial writings on Beuys and his work, presenting key essays by prominent artists and critics from North America and Europe. With a foreword by Arthur C. Danto, &#x201c;Style and Salvation in the Art of Beuys,&#x201d; Benjamin H. D. Buchloh's now classic 1980 essay, &#x201c;Beuys, Twilight of the Idol,&#x201d; and influential texts by Vera Frenkel, Thierry de Duve, Rosalind Krauss, Peter B�rger, Irit Rogoff, and others, <i>Joseph Beuys: The Reader </i>is the most significant gathering of critical texts on this challenging artist that has ever been assembled.

The text is based on historical documents, two passenger accounts of the actual trip, and other voyages of the time. In a section at the end, the author explains her research; and distinguishes fact from fiction. Kendall's clear, full-color photographs, shot on the Mayflower II, complement the story. This book is well written, designed, and photographed. A good choice for patrons who enjoyed Waters and Kendall's Samuel Eaton's Day (1993) and Sarah Morton's Day (1989, both Scholastic).?Charlyn Lyons, Wichita Public Library, KS<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 3^-5. Similar to Waters and Kendall's earlier works about children in the 1620s, <i>Sarah Morton's Day</i> (1989), <i>Samuel Eaton's Day</i> (1993), and <i>Tapenum's Day</i> (1994), this book tells of two young people crossing the Atlantic on the <i>Mayflower</i>. The narrator is William Small, apprentice to the ship's master; Ellen Moore is the young passenger he befriends. Readers can follow the journey from these two different perspectives. Full-color photographs of costumed characters aboard the <i>Mayflower II</i> illustrate the story, making it more vivid than most accounts of the <i>Mayflower</i> voyage. Although the photos sometimes look posed, they provide intriguing glimpses of seventeenth-century ways; many of the pictures are quite handsome in their own right. A good addition to American history collections. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>The Kindness of Strangers (Lonely Planet Travel Literature)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher*</i></p><p>A timely collection of 26 inspiring tales, <b>The Kindness of Strangers</b> explores the unexpected human connections that so often transfigure and transform the experience of travel, and celebrates the gift of kindness around the world. <b>Featuring stories by</b> Jan Morris, Tim Cahill, Simon Winchester and Dave Eggers.</p><p>I <i>greatly appreciate the theme of this book that gathers stories of kindness received when it was most needed and perhaps least expected.

Anthony (Landmark Law Cases &amp; American Society)</h2><p>Just as the polls opened on November 5, 1872, Susan B. Anthony arrived and filled out her "ticket" for the various candidates. But before it could be placed in the ballot box, a poll watcher objected, claiming her action violated the laws of New York and the state constitution. Anthony vehemently protested that as a citizen of the United States and the state of New York she was entitled to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment. The poll watchers gave in and allowed Anthony to deposit her ballots. Anthony was arrested, charged with a federal crime, and tried in court. <br><br>Primarily represented within document collections and broader accounts of the fight for woman suffrage, Anthony's controversial trial&#x2014;as a landmark narrative in the annals of American law&#x2014;remains a relatively neglected subject. N. E. H. Hull provides the first book-length engagement with the legal dimensions of that narrative and in the process illuminates the laws, politics, and personalities at the heart of the trial and its outcome. <br><br>Hull summarizes the woman suffrage movement in the post-Civil War era, reveals its betrayal by former allies in the abolitionist movement, and describes its fall into disarray. She then chronicles Anthony's vote, arrest, and preliminary hearings, as well as the legal and public relations maneuvering in the run-up to the trial. She captures the drama created by Anthony, her attorneys, the politically ambitious prosecutor, and presiding judge&#x2014;and Supreme Court justice&#x2014;Ward Hunt, who argued emphatically against Anthony's interpretation of the Reconstruction Amendments as the source of her voting rights. She then tracks further relevant developments in the trial's aftermath&#x2014;including <i>Minor v. Happersett</i>, another key case for the voting rights of women&#x2014;and follows the major players through the eventual passage of the Nineteenth (or "Susan B. Anthony") Amendment. <br><br>Hull's concise and readable guide reveals a story of courage and despair, of sisterhood and rivalry, of high purpose and low politics. It also underscores for all of us how Anthony's act of civil disobedience remains essential to our understanding of both constitutional and women's history&#x2014;and why it all matters.</p><p>N. E. H. Hull is Distinguished Professor of Law and a member of the graduate faculty in history at Rutgers University Camden. She is the author of <i>Roscoe Pound and Karl Llewellyn: Searching for an American Jurisprudence</i> and <i>Female Felons: Women and Serious Crime in Colonial Massachusetts,</i> and coauthor of <i>The Supreme Court: An Essential History; Murdering Mothers: Infanticide in England and New England, 1558 1803;</i> and <i>Roe v. Wade: The Abortion Rights Controversy in American History</i>."This rich, readable recounting brings the trial and its principals to life. Serious general readers and specialists in law, American history, and women's rights will appreciate its depth and readability as well as the authors skill in illuminating both historic setting and contemporary impact." <i><b>Library Journal</b></i><p>"This wonderful book contextualizes Anthonys trial within the broader battle for female franchise. It begins before the Civil War with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and others in 1848 at Seneca Falls, New York, organizing for womens rights. Hull discusses the personalities involved in the female franchise and how it was connected to the temperance movement, abolition, and the battle over the Fifteenth Amendment granting former slaves the right to vote. . . . While the trial is described here as a sham, it was significant in the eventual success in securing a right to vote. Excellent for collections on women's, New York, and American history and law. Highly recommended."<i><b>Choice</b></i></p><p>"Hull brings to life the cast of characters, from the befuddled male poll workers to the imperious Supreme Court Justice Ward Hunt (who presided at the trial) to the passionate and committed Anthony. . . . [The book] takes an episode often dismissed as a footnote in the larger history of the womens suffrage movement and places it center stage. . . . It will have broad appeal to readers who are interested in the intersection of women, suffrage, and the law in the late nineteenth-century United States."<i><b>Kansas History</b></i><br><br>A truly refreshing, invigorating, and spirited story! Hulls close legal study of the charges against Anthony breaks new ground and significantly enlarges our understanding of her trial, its degeneration into a theater of the absurd, and its setback for U.S. womens rights and recognition as citizens. A must read for students of womens history and law alike.<b>Kathleen Barry</b>, author of <i>Susan B.

What is luck? A psychic gift or a question of intelligence? And what is it that lucky people have that unlucky people lack? Psychologist Dr. Richard Wiseman put luck under a scientific microscope for the very first time, examining the different ways in which lucky and unlucky people think and behave. After three years of intensive interviews and experiments with over 400 volunteers, Wiseman arrived at an astonishing conclusion: Luck is something that can be learned. It is available to anyone willing to pay attention to the Four Essential Principles: </p><p>. Creating Chance Opportunities <br>. Thinking Lucky <br>. Feeling Lucky <br>. Denying Fate </p><p>Readers can determine their capacity for luck as well as learn to change their luck through helpful exercises that appear throughout the book. Illustrated with anecdotes from the lives of the famous such as Harry Truman and Warren Buffett, The Luck Factor also richly portrays the lives of ordinary people who have been extraordinarily lucky or unlucky. Finally Dr. Wiseman gives us a look into "The Luck School" where he instructs unlucky people and also teaches lucky people how to further enhance their luck. </p><p>Smart, enlightening, fun to read, and easy to follow, The Luck Factor will give you revolutionary insight into the lucky mind and could, quite simply, change your life. </p></p><p>Dr. Richard Wiseman heads a research unit within the psychology department at the University of Herfordshire in Britain and was recently given the prestigious CSICOP Public Education in Science Award. This is his first book.Filled with real-life stories from hundreds of interviews; inspirational quotes from the likes of Benjamin Franklin and Oprah Winfrey; and graphed research data from his eight-year study of luck, Wiseman's book promises to offer "a scientifically proven way to understand, control, and increase your luck." While many believe luck is a mystical force influenced by superstitious rituals, Wiseman, psychology chair at the University of Herfordshire in England, claims lucky people simply possess four basic psychological traits unlucky people don't: the ability to maximize chance opportunities, to listen to "gut feelings," to expect good fortune and to see the bright side of bad luck. Questionnaires and exercises offer guidance on how to acquire or enhance luckiness while keeping a "luck journal" and incorporating techniques to increase intuition, stop negative self-fulfilling prophecies and learn how to effectively network. The format is marked by redundant chapter summaries, but Wiseman's upbeat, charismatic tone might persuade even skeptical readers of the transformative effect luck can have in their personal and professional lives. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Holbein&#39;s Ambassadors : Making and Meaning</h2><p>A study of Holbein&#39;s portrait entitled &#34;The Ambassadors&#34;.

In Whisperers, bestselling novelist and expert on the occult J. H. Brennan explores how the &#34;spirit world&#34;--whether we believe in it or not--has influenced our own since the dawn of civilization. With a novelist&#39;s flair and a scholar&#39;s keen eye, Brennan details the supernatural affinities of world leaders from King Nebuchadnezzar to Adolf Hitler, showing how the decisions and policies of each have been shaped by their supernatural beliefs and encounters.

And it reinvigorated him. <br><br>The result is an immensely engaging, insightful, and idiosyncratic journey, filled with unexpected delights and strange encounters. A bestseller and major prizewinner in Italy, <b>A Fortune-Teller Told Me</b> is a powerful warning against the new missionaries of materialism.</p><p>It was 1976 when Tiziano Terzani was warned by the fortuneteller in Hong Kong: "Beware! You run a grave risk of dying in 1993. You mustn't fly that year. Don't fly, not even once." Sixteen years later, Terzani had not forgotten. Despite living the life of a jet-hopping journalist, he decided that, after a lifetime of sensible decisions, he would confront the prophecy the Asian way, not by fighting it, but by submitting. He also resolved that on the way he would seek out the most eminent local oracle, fortuneteller, or sorcerer and look again into his future. So after a feast of red-ant egg omelet and a glass of fresh water, he brought the new year in on the back of an elephant. He even made it to his appointments: Cambodia, to cover the first democratic elections; Burma, for the opening of the first road to connect Thailand and China; and even Florence, to visit his mother, a trip that would take him 13,000 miles across Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Mongolia, and Siberia. In this way, that jet-hopping journalist rediscovered the art of travel, the intricate chains of chance which lead to discovery, and the mass of humanity he'd overlooked in his rush for newsworthy quotes. And he also saved his life.<p> Terzani's odyssey across Asia is full of revelations and reflections on the dramatic changes underway in Asia. Having spent two decades on the continent, he brings a deep love for the place to his journeys, but also the eyes of someone troubled by the changes he sees. Burma and Laos, finally open to outside contact, are now funnels for AIDS and drugs; Thailand has been traumatized by its rapid development; China is an anarchy fueled by money rather than ideology, where Mao has been transformed into the god of traffic. Surrounded by the loss of diversity wrought by modernism, Terzani asks if the "missionaries of materialism and economic progress" aren't destroying the continent in order to save it. Fortunately, there is a flip side to his occasionally dispiriting commentary, one that Terzani discovers in his hunt for fortunetellers. Through his side trips to seers who read the soles of his feet, the ashes of incense, and even the burned scapula of sheep, it becomes clear that the Orient of legends, myths, and magic still determines people's lives as much as the quest for money. By staying earthbound, Terzani lived to tell of an extraordinary journey through the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of Asia.--<i>Lesley Reed</i></p>&#x201c;Terzani is already something of a legend.

He is known for his distinctive saturated hues and idealized neo-classical imagery. Parrish was one of the most successful and prolific of the illustrators and painters of the Golden Age of Illustration. He was earning over $100,000 per year by 1910, at a time when a fine home could be purchased for $2,000. Norman Rockwell referred to Parrish as &#34;my idol.&#34; Parrish, although unique in his execution and never duplicated, exhibited considerable influence upon other illustrators and artists, an influence which continues through the present. His original paintings are highly sought-after when they come to market, as well as his first-edition prints, which continue to command high prices at both auction and through private sales. His exacting attention to detail preceded the Photorealist and Hyper-Realist art movements, and his abundant imagination and love of fantasy elements have also influenced artists in myriad media. Parrish&#39;s art features dazzlingly luminous colors; the color Parrish blue was named in acknowledgement. He achieved the results by means of a technique called glazing where bright layers of oil color separated by varnish are applied alternately over a base rendering (Parrish usually used a blue and white monochromatic underpainting). He would build up the depth in his paintings by photographing, enlarging, projecting and tracing half- or full-size objects or figures. Parrish then cut out and placed the images on his canvas, covering them with thick, but clear, layers of glaze. The result is realism of elegiac vivacity. The posters in this book include: The Canyon, The Gulnare of the Sea, The Millpond, Land of Make-Believe, Harvest, Cadmus Sowing the Dragon&#39;s Teeth, Wild Geese, White Birch/Winter, The Manager Draws the Curtain, Waterfall, Air Castles, Prometheus, Poets Dream, Venice--Twilight, Garden of Allah, and 12 others.</p><p>able for framing from the major periods of an artist known for his luminous colors, nymphlike forms, and the romance, flamboyance, and sensuality of his work. <b>24 posters in full color.</b></p><h2>And to Each Season ...</h2><p>The contemporary poet&#39;s thoughts on love, loneliness, and freedom mirror his own experiences and search for truth</p><p></p><h2>Rainforests (Usborne Beginners Level 1: Nature)</h2><p>Introduces the various levels of the rain forest and the plants and animals that live there, and discusses native people and contemporary threats to the rain forest.</p><p></p><h2>THE ADVENTURE OF THE CHRISTMAS PUDDING</h2><p>THE ADVENTURE OF THE CHRISTMAS PUDDING</p><p></p><h2>God&#39;s Story for Me Bible Storybook: 104 Favorite Bible Stories for Children</h2><p>The Bible, just for little kids!

Banished from his home for a murder he didn't intend to commit, Bjarni takes up a new life as a mercenary. He journeys from England to Dublin, and then to the islands off the west coast of Scotland. There he meets the man who is to shape the course of his life for years to come, a life that will lead him from boyhood to manhood--fighting among the clan chiefs from the west coast of Scotland in feuds as bitter and bloody as can be imagined.<br><br>Discovered among her papers after her death in 1992, <i>Sword Song</i> is a fitting capstone to Rosemary Sutcliff's marvelous career as one of Britain's premier authors of historical fiction.<br></p><p><b>Rosemary Sutcliff </b>(1920-92) wrote dozens of novels for young readers, including the award-winning trilogy set in Roman Britain, <i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i>,<i> The Silver Branch, </i>and <i>The Lantern Bearers</i>. Shortly before her death, she was awarded the CBE, one of Britain's most prestigious honors. <br>Grade 7 Up-Exiled from his home for five years, 16-year-old Bjarni Sigurdson is forced to support himself by becoming a mercenary. Although he is young and untried, he sells his sword service first to Onund Treefoot and later to Thorstein the Red, Norse chieftains who have settled in the islands west of Scotland. With his black dog Hugin in tow, the young man learns the ways of the sea and of warfare as he follows these men in battle and in peace. After five years, he decides to return home, but is cast ashore during a violent storm for one final adventure. The action-filled plot develops coherently and is less episodic than those of many journey tales. Bjarni is an appealing, well-rounded character whose growth and development keep the story focused. His early experiences are those of an adolescent, as he chases after Onund's enemies. Thorstein is involved in more serious matters, making treaties and establishing settlements, and Bjarni, too, becomes more reflective, considering his behavior and his future plans. Sutcliff wrote historical fiction as if she lived it, and this book is no exception. Particularly interesting is her portrayal of the coexistence of the old religion of the Norsemen and that of the White Christ. Although the author did not complete the final draft before her death, this is a well-crafted story that will appeal to sophisticated readers. In places the language is slightly less polished than usual, and Bjarni's final adventure is not as well integrated into the plot as the earlier ones, but still, this is vintage Sutcliff.<br><i>Barbara Scotto, Michael Driscoll School, Brookline, MA</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Noises Off: A Play in Three Acts</h2><p><b>Noises Off</b><i>, </i>the classic farce by the Tony Award&#x2014;winning author of <i>Copenhagen, </i>is not one play but two: simultaneously a traditional sex farce, <i>Nothing On,</i> and the backstage &#x201c;drama&#x201d; that develops during <i>Nothing On</i>&#x2019;s final rehearsal and tour.

The ground shook as the monstrously ornate demonic siege engines on the walls of the Black Temple rained death down on the blood elf forces of Prince Kael&#x2019;thas Sunstrider, strewing the red earth of Outland with their corpses. Despite their losses, the elves pushed forward, determined to take the citadel of Magtheridon, lord of Outland, the Burning Legion&#x2019;s satrap in this shattered world.<br><br>Illidan paused for a moment and studied the Black Temple. To inexperienced eyes, the defenses might look immeasurably strong, but he saw that they had been neglected. There were too few sentries for the span of the towering walls, the warding spells were starting to unravel, and the metal struts of the gates were stained with rust and verdigris. The defenders responded slowly, as if they could not quite believe they were being assaulted by a force so much smaller than their own. Perhaps they expected to be relieved by demonic allies. If so, they were doomed to disappointment. Illidan and his companions had spent the whole long, hot Outland day sealing the gates through which the demons were summoned. No aid was coming from that source.<br><br>Illidan glanced over at Prince Kael&#x2019;thas. &#x201c;Magtheridon has grown strong over the years, but he has had few real foes to contend with. He has become decadent and complacent. The boisterous cur cannot match our cunning or our will.&#x201d;<br><br>The tall, fair blood elf prince looked up at him. The fierce joy of combat blazed in his eyes. &#x201c;This will be a glorious battle, master. Though Magtheridon&#x2019;s forces vastly outnumber ours, your soldiers are prepared to fight to the end.&#x201d;<br><br>Illidan hoped that would not prove necessary. He needed to seize the Black Temple and mastery of Outland quickly if he was to make himself secure against the vengeance of the demon lord Kil&#x2019;jaeden. Kil&#x2019;jaeden had set Illidan a task after he rejoined the Burning Legion&#x2014;�to destroy the Frozen Throne and hence eliminate a rebellious servant&#x2014;�and he had not completed it. The Deceiver did not reward failure. Illidan believed that closing the demonic portals could thwart Kil&#x2019;jaeden&#x2019;s attempts to locate him. Winning this fortress would give him a stronger base of operations for keeping the portals closed.<br><br>An elven sorcerer raised his hand and sent a bolt of arcane energy lancing toward the walls. Badly maintained or not, the defenses were enough to prevent it from striking the siege engine. A ball of fire arced down toward the mage, gouging the blood-�red earth as the defenders sought his range. A company of Kael&#x2019;thas&#x2019;s soldiers raced past en route to the shelter of the walls.<br><br>Illidan clenched his fists as he sensed the demons within the temple. Here in the foreign world of Outland, he felt the temptation of demonic magic even more strongly than usual, especially after he had consumed the potency within the Skull of Gul&#x2019;dan. The surge of evil energy from that artifact had transformed him, changing both his physical form and the depth of his power, but it had put him off balance for months. He flexed his newly gained demonic wings, earning a concerned glance from Prince Kael&#x2019;thas. Illidan took a deep breath and forced himself to be calm.<br><br>It was a long, strange road that had brought him to this pass. Since Tyrande had freed him, he had seen the overthrow of the Burning Legion on his homeworld of Azeroth, made a pact with a demon lord, and fled to Outland to evade his enemies, both night elven and demonic. He had been recaptured by his old nemesis, Maiev, and then freed by his allies, the young prince Kael&#x2019;thas&#x2014;�whose allegiance Illidan had earned by pledging to help the blood elves sate their addiction to magic&#x2014;�and Lady Vashj, a leader of the naga. Now he found himself scheming to overthrow the pit lord who ruled this shattered world in the name of the Burning Legion.<br><br>Kael&#x2019;thas stared at him, expecting an answer to his promise of loyalty. Illidan said, &#x201c;I am pleased by your people&#x2019;s zeal, young Kael. Their spirits and powers have been honed in this harsh wilderness. Their courage alone may be enough to&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lord Illidan, new arrivals come to greet you.&#x201d; The voice of Lady Vashj cut him off as she slithered into view. Great bands of muscle pulsed and bulged as she moved, twisting the coils of her lower body. Her oddly beautiful face, reminiscent of a night elf&#x2019;s, contrasted with the horror of her serpentine form.<br><br>Illidan turned to look in the direction she indicated. A pack of monstrous figures lumbered into view. Illidan recognized them at once. They were Broken, corrupted and devolved former members of the draenei race who had inhabited Draenor before it was shattered into Outland. They, too, were part of Illidan&#x2019;s coalition, bound to him by promises of aid against their common enemy, Magtheridon.<br><br>The Broken were hulking, ungraceful monsters, bearing primitive weapons in their huge hands. Illidan&#x2019;s mystical senses detected that more of them were nearby, potent magic concealing them from those who lacked his spectral sight.<br><br>One of the Broken, even more massive and twisted of form than the rest, limped forward on hoofed feet. &#x201c;We have fought the orcs and their demon masters for generations,&#x201d; the figure said. His voice rasped from within his chest. It seemed to pain him to speak. &#x201c;Now, at last, we will end their curse forever. We are yours to command, Lord Illidan.&#x201d;<br><br>It was Akama, leader of the Broken. He was not a reassuring figure. Fangs jutted up from his lower jaw. Tentacles writhed out from the bottom half of his face.<br><br>&#x201c;You have arrived just in time,&#x201d; said Illidan. &#x201c;Those machines on the walls must be silenced, and the gate must be opened.&#x201d;<br><br>Akama nodded and gestured. The near-�invisible Broken swarmed forward across the open ground and clambered up the walls of the Black Temple. A small force of blood elves and naga took shelter against the monstrous fortifications, beneath the firing arcs of the demonic engines. Illidan, Kael&#x2019;thas, and Lady Vashj moved to join them, along with Akama and his bodyguards.<br><br>Once again, the so-�called lord of Outland&#x2019;s overconfidence was revealed. A properly prepared fortress would have vats of boiling oil or alchemical fire ready to pour down on attackers. The defenders did nothing. Long minutes ticked by. This close to the walls, Illidan could hear the hum of the magical generators that powered the demonic war machines.<br><br>Suddenly the sounds of combat came from within the walls, and the great gates of the Black Temple swung open. Akama and his bodyguards raced forward to join the fray. Explosions sounded as the Broken destroyed the generators, and the war machines on the walls fell silent. The main bulk of the naga and blood elf force advanced toward the gate once more.<br><br>Akama returned, hideous face jubilant. He had waited a long time for this day. Illidan smiled and said, &#x201c;As I promised, your people shall have their vengeance, Akama. By night&#x2019;s end, we will all be drunk with it. Vashj, Kael, give the final order to strike. The hour of wrath has come!&#x201d;<br><br>Through the open gates, Illidan could see a vast courtyard stacked high with bones. Red-�skinned fel orcs milled around in confusion as their leaders bellowed commands and tried to get them into some semblance of order to repel the invaders.<br><br>Within the Black Temple, there were probably ten fel orcs for every one of Illidan&#x2019;s troops. Each had been twisted by foul magic into something far stronger and fiercer than a normal orc. It counted for nothing now. Illidan&#x2019;s forces swept into the courtyard, a tight wedge that cleaved through their disorganized enemy as easily as their blades sliced orcish flesh.<br><br>Illidan plunged his talons into the chest of a fel orc. Bone crunched as he closed his fingers and ripped open a cavity to pull the heart free. The fel orc roared and lunged forward, jaws snapping in an attempt to tear out Illidan&#x2019;s throat even as the creature died.<br><br>Illidan raised the corpse above his head and tossed it into the onrushing squad of red-�skinned defenders. Its weight bowled them over, sending them tumbling to the ground. He leapt amid them, freeing his warglaives from their sheaths. He lashed out, striking to left and right with irresistible force. His enemies fell, decapitated, limbless, mutilated. Blood covered him. He licked it from his lips and moved forward, slashing and slicing as he went.<br><br>All around, the dying screamed. Magic thundered as Prince Kael&#x2019;thas and Lady Vashj unleashed their spells. Illidan was tempted to do so himself, but he wanted to preserve his strength for the final conflict with Magtheridon.<br><br>Part of him took pleasure in the clash of arms. There was nothing quite like shedding the blood of your foes with your own hands. Deep within him, the chained demon part of his nature enjoyed feeding this way.<br><br>The fel orcs fought well, but they were no match for Illidan and his comrades. The naga were much larger and more physically powerful. They wrapped their enemies within their serpentine coils and squeezed the life out of them.<br><br>The blood elves were masters of sorcery and swords. They might not be as strong as the fel orcs, but they were faster and more agile, and bonds of loyalty stronger than life itself drove them to defend their prince.<br><br>The Broken fought with the determination of a people driven to free their homeland from the grip of demons. The howls of dying fel orcs rose to the heavens in protest as they dropped before the hungry blades of their enemies. Within minutes the courtyard was cleared, the fel orcs were routed, and the way into the Black Temple&#x2019;s inner citadel and Magtheridon&#x2019;s chambers lay open.<br><br>&#x201c;Victory is ours,&#x201d; said Akama. &#x201c;The Temple of Karabor will belong to my people once again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The temple will be returned to your people,&#x201d; Illidan said. He replaced his warglaives in their sheaths. &#x201c;In good time.&#x201d; It was true. He fully intended to give back the Black Temple to the Broken. Once he had achieved his goals.<br><br>Akama looked at him with rheumy eyes. He interlaced his stubby fingers and bobbed his head, his need to believe etched on his face. The Temple of Karabor had been the most sacred site of his people before Magtheridon&#x2019;s desecration turned it into the Black Temple. Illidan sensed it had a deep personal significance to the Broken himself. That was a string that could be tugged to make him dance, if the need arose. Not that what Akama wanted counted for anything. Illidan&#x2019;s purpose far outweighed the desires of any Broken. He had planned too long to let scruples stand in his way.<br><br>&#x201c;When we overcome the pit lord, most of his fel orc lieutenants will support us,&#x201d; Illidan said. &#x201c;They follow the strongest, and we will have shown that their faith in Magtheridon was misplaced. Such summoned demons as remain within the temple will be bound in fealty to me, or they will die their final death.&#x201d;<br><br>Vashj nodded. &#x201c;Cut off the head and the body falls,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;You will slay Magtheridon, Lord?&#x201d; Akama asked.<br><br>Illidan allowed himself a cruel smile. &#x201c;We shall do much worse than that,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;And what would that be?&#x201d; Akama spoke slowly. Illidan heard the doubt in his voice. Clearly, Akama had reservations about what they were doing.<br><br>&#x201c;You will need to wait and see,&#x201d; Illidan said.<br><br>&#x201c;As you wish, Lord,&#x201d; Akama said. &#x201c;So shall it be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then let us be about our business,&#x201d; said Illidan. &#x201c;We have a world to conquer.&#x201d;<br><br>The doorway to the throne room slid open. The stench of demon assaulted Illidan&#x2019;s nostrils. Flames leapt around Magtheridon&#x2019;s throne of bones. The pit lord loomed more than five times the height of a blood elf, a centaur-�like creature with two arms and a quadruped lower half, as massive as a dragon. Magtheridon&#x2019;s legs were like the columns supporting the roof of some ancient temple. They lifted his underbelly so high that an elf could walk beneath it. In one huge hand, he held a glaive as long as the mast of an oceangoing ship, weighty as a battering ram. Flanking him were two gigantic, batwinged doomguard, each almost as tall as their master, and a force of lesser demons. Illidan sensed their power and their hostility.<br><br>The pit lord turned his burning eyes upon Illidan. When he spoke, his voice was deep and guttural. &#x201c;I do not know you, stranger, but your power is vast. Are you an agent of the Legion? Have you been sent here to test me?&#x201d;<br><br>Illidan laughed. &#x201c;I have come to replace you. You are a relic, Magtheridon, a ghost of a past age. The future is mine. From this moment on, Outland and all its denizens will bow to me.&#x201d;<br><br>The pit lord lumbered forward, raising his gigantic glaive. The earth shook beneath his tread. &#x201c;I will crush you like the insect you are. I will feast upon your pulped flesh and devour your soul with it.&#x201d;<br><br>He spoke with the overweening self-�confidence of one who thought his might was unchallengeable. His demonic bodyguards advanced. Illidan sprang, warglaives scything through the air to bite into demon flesh. His blow slashed the arm from a felguard, forcing the creature to drop his axe. A heartbeat later Illidan&#x2019;s left-�hand warglaive sliced his opponent open from neck to groin.<br><br>Illidan&#x2019;s own forces advanced into the fray. The doomguard were mighty, but they were few. Buffeted by the spells of Kael&#x2019;thas and Vashj and surrounded by assailants, the doomguard were slain like bears being dragged down by a pack of hounds.<br><br>Illidan bounded forward to confront Magtheridon himself. The pit lord&#x2019;s huge glaive crashed down, biting into the stone where Illidan had stood. He was already away, rolling between the lord of Outland&#x2019;s columnar legs, hamstringing each of the front ones with a double swipe of his blades. The pit lord roared with fury and struck again. Illidan tumbled forward under his foe&#x2019;s belly, drawing forth ichor with his strikes. He vaulted onto Magtheridon&#x2019;s massive tail, ran up his spine, and drove his blades into the demon&#x2019;s thick neck.<br><br>From Illidan&#x2019;s vantage point, he could see that his forces had felled the pit lord&#x2019;s bodyguards. The demons were finished. Illidan raised his hands high and chanted the spell of binding. A wave of unleashed magical energy hit the pit lord. Magtheridon flinched as the spell began to bite.<br><br>Illidan&#x2019;s heart thundered as he exerted his will. He felt as if he were engaged in a tug-�of-�war with a giant. Magtheridon&#x2019;s advance slowed. His face twisted as if he, too, felt the strain.<br><br>&#x201c;You are strong&#x2014;�for a mortal,&#x201d; the pit lord said.<br><br>&#x201c;I am not a mortal,&#x201d; said Illidan.<br><br>&#x201c;Anything that can be killed is mortal.&#x201d;</p><h2>The China Bride (The Bride Trilogy)</h2><p>Born to a Scottish father and a Chinese mother, Troth Montgomery dreamed of someday traveling to Scotland, until the death of her father condemned her to a shadowy life as an interpreter in Canton.

Striped with beauty and written in short propulsive chapters &#x2013; full of upheavals, reversals and abrupt twists of plot &#x2013; the novel powerfully sketches a time of change and loss. Prophetic and regretful, intuitive and exact, Roth tells of one man&#x2019;s foppish, sleepwalking, spoiled youth and then his struggle to come to terms with the uncongenial society of post-First World War Vienna, financial ruin, and the first intimations of Nazi barbarities.</p><p>Joseph Roth (1894-1939) was the great elegist of the cosmopolitan culture that flourished in the dying days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

City College was a tuition-free, merit-based college in Harlem known far more for its intellectual achievements and political radicalism than its athletic prowess. Only two years after Jackie Robinson broke the Major League Baseball color barrier&#x2014;and at a time when the National Basketball Association was still segregated&#x2014;every single member of the Beavers was either Jewish or African American. But during that remarkable season, under the guidance of the legendary former player Nat Holman, this unheralded group of city kids would stun the basketball world by becoming the only team in history to win the NIT and NCAA tournaments in the same year.<br><br> This team, though, proved to be extraordinary in another way: During the following season, all of the team&#x2019;s starting five were arrested by New York City detectives, charged with conspiring with gamblers to shave points. Almost overnight these beloved heroes turned into fallen idols. The story centers on two teammates and close friends, Eddie Roman and Floyd Layne, one white, one black, each caught up in the scandal, each searching for a path to personal redemption. Though banned from the NBA, Layne continued to devote himself to basketball, teaching the game to young people in his Bronx neighborhood and, ultimately, with Roman&#x2019;s help, finding another kind of triumph&#x2014;one that no one could have anticipated.<br><br> Drawing on interviews with the surviving members of that championship team, Matthew Goodman has created an indelible portrait of an era of smoke-filled arenas and Borscht Belt hotels, when college basketball was far more popular than the professional game. It was a time when gangsters controlled illegal sports betting, the police were on their payroll, and everyone, it seemed, was getting rich&#x2014;except for the young men who actually played the games.&nbsp;<br><br>Tautly paced and rich with period detail, <i>The City Game</i> tells a story both dramatic and poignant: of political corruption, duplicity in big-time college sports, and the deeper meaning of athletic success.</p><p><b>Matthew Goodman</b>&nbsp;is the author of three previous books of nonfiction:&nbsp;<i>Eighty Days: Nellie Bly and Elizabeth Bisland&#x2019;s History-Making Race Around the World</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Sun and the Moon: The Remarkable True Account of Hoaxers, Showmen, Dueling Journalists, and Lunar Man-Bats in Nineteenth-Century New York</i>; and&nbsp;<i>Jewish Food: The World at Table</i>.

But their plans go awry when they arrive to find Jared already on the throne! And it's nowhere near the joyful reunion one might expect --- instead, Dessa is captured and thrown into the dungeon!

The traditional Korean tales in this collection are full of amazing events and characters. Sad, happy, romantic, and funny, together they bring vividly to life the magic of Korea.</p><p>Grade 4-8?These 20 tales, for which no source notes are given, are for the most part clearly and pleasantly told, and are suitable for reading aloud or storytelling. They are not, however, as lively or attractive as similar stories published as individual picture books. "The Snail Woman" calls to mind Lawrence Yep's The Shell Woman and the King (Dial, 1993), and "The Distant Journey" is reminiscent of Rosalind Wang's The Fourth Question (Holiday, 1991). Similarities also exist between "The Hare's Liver" and Paul Galdone's The Monkey and the Crocodile (Clarion, 1987); "The Long-Nosed Princess" and Warwick Hutton's The Nose Tree (McElderry, 1981; o.p.); and between "The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars" and the Grimms' "The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids." Two of the selections are earthy, with urination playing a major role in them. The volume also includes a story relating the mythical origins of Korea and an adequate retelling of the Asian tale about the weaver princess and the herdsman. Strictly additional.?Diane S.

Every buffet line has a dessert section, however, and when a cousin calls with a Hollywood apartment to sublet, it seems as though Candy is finally offered something sweet. It&#x2019;s good-bye to Minnesota and hello to California, where a girl who has always lived by her wits has a real chance of making a living with them. With that, the irrepressible Lorna Landvik launches her latest irresistible character onto the world stage&#x2014;or at least onto the dimly lit small stage where stand-up comedy gets its start.</p><p>Herself a comic performer, Landvik taps her own adventurous past and Minnesota roots to conjure Candy&#x2019;s life in this strange new Technicolor home. Her fellow tenants at Peyton Hall include a female bodybuilder, a ruined nightclub impresario, and a well-connected old Romanian fortune-teller. There are game show appearances and temp jobs at a record company and an establishment suspiciously like the Playboy Mansion, and of course the alluring but not always welcoming stage of stand-up comedy. As she hones her act, Candy is tested by humiliation, hecklers, and the inherent sexism that insists &#x201c;chicks aren&#x2019;t funny.&#x201d;</p><p>Written with the light touch and quiet wisdom that have made her works so popular, this is classic Lorna Landvik&#x2014;sometimes so funny, you&#x2019;ll cry; sometimes so sad, you might as well laugh; and always impossible to put down. <br></p></p><p><p>Lorna Landvik is the best-selling author of many novels including <i>Patty Jane&#x2019;s House of Curl</i>, <i>Angry Housewives Eating Bon-Bons</i>, <i>Oh My Stars</i>, and most recently, <i>Mayor of the Universe </i>(Minnesota, 2014). She has performed stand-up and improvisational comedy around the country and is also a public speaker, playwright, and actor, most recently seen in an all-improvised, one-woman show <i>Party in the Rec Room.</i></p><i>"Best to Laugh</i> is cheerfully outlandish, filled with ambition, love, adventure, kindness, swimming pools, nightclubs, and baked goods. Best of all, it&#x2019;s laugh-out-loud hilarious." &#x2014;Julie Schumacher, author of <i>The Unbearable Book Club for Unsinkable Girls</i><br><br>&nbsp;<i>"Best to Laugh</i> had me laughing out loud. It&#x2019;s both funny and tender, and filled with memorable characters. You can&#x2019;t help but love Candy Pekkala and her quirky, mixologist grandmother. Lorna Landvik has written a charming novel with real heart." &#x2014;Shannon Olson, author of <i>Welcome to My Planet</i><br><br>&nbsp;"One of the things that accounts for Lorna Landvik&#x2019;s immense popularity is the essential good-heartedness she brings to her work. But as much as this is a celebration of a very special time and place, it is even more a celebration of character, desire, friendship, perseverance, and love&#x2014;oh, and hamburger hot dish." &#x2014;Elizabeth Berg, author of <i>Tapestry of Fortunes</i> and <i>The Day I Ate Whatever I Wanted</i><br><br>"GREAT NOVEL!!! It reads like an autobiography! <i>Best to Laugh,</i> although fiction, is one of the truest accounts of a Hollywood life one can read. It takes a master of comedy to be able to write about the business of laughter. To interpret its roots and inner working.&nbsp; Lorna Lanvik is precisely that. I, for one of many, can attribute countless gut busting laughs to the genius of Lorna. A great nostalgic tale." &#x2014;Mo Collins, actress/comedian<br><br>"Landvik&#x2019;s novel is happily filled with a double dose of nostalgia&#x2014;the protagonist&#x2019;s for the golden age of Hollywood and the author&#x2019;s for a lovably gritty 1970s Los Angeles." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> "Filled with historical lore about Hollywood&#x2019;s glory days, inside observations about the chauvinism that pervades the comedy boys&#x2019; club, and a bevy of secondary characters straight out of central casting, Landvik&#x2019;s homage to funny ladies everywhere is a joyful, breezy trip down memory lane." &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br> "<i>Best to Laugh</i> recounts real&#x2014;poignant and laugh-out-loud funny&#x2014;experience." &#x2014;<i>Star Tribune</i><br><br> "<i>Best to Laugh</i> has Landvik&#x2019;s signature humor&#x2014;a little corny, a lot sweet&#x2014;and the sort of friends-become-family characters that defined her best-selling debut <i>Patty Jane&#x2019;s House of Curl</i>. There is a <i>Steel Magnolias</i>-style of laugh-aw-cry-laugh likability to the tale and the 1970s-ness is so palpable, you can practically hear the whisper-walk of a woman&#x2019;s silk pantsuit." &#x2014;<i>Duluth News-Tribune</i></p><h2>The MacGregors: Robert &amp; Cybil</h2><p><b>The Winning Hand</b><br><br>When Darcy Wallace spends her last three dollars at the hotel casino and wins a jackpot worth almost two million dollars, all casino manager Robert MacGregor Blade wants to do is look out for her. But something about the lovely young woman is getting under Mac's skin and playing havoc with his big brotherly intentions. And to win her over, he'll have to take the biggest gamble of his life.<br><b>The Perfect Neighbor</b><br><br>Brooding loner Preston McQuinn's new apartment, like his life, was just the way he wanted it&#x2014;dark and empty. But when sunny Cybil Campbell came barging into his well-ordered gloom, he couldn't deny a grudging fascination with his bright, bubbly neighbor. Preston thought he'd closed the door on love for good, so why was he suddenly longing to open up his heart to his incredibly perfect neighbor?</p><p>Nora Roberts is the bestselling author of more than two hundred romance novels.

There are more than five hundred million copies of her books in print, published in over thirty-four countries.<br>When her car sputtered and died a mile outside of Las Vegas, Darcy Wallace seriously considered staying where she was and baking to death under the brutal desert sun. She had $9.37 left in her pocket and a long stretch of road behind her that led to nowhere.<p> </p><p>She was lucky to have even that pitiful amount of cash on her, as her purse had been stolen outside a diner in Utah the night before. The rubbery chicken sandwich was the last meal she'd had, and she figured the stray ten she'd found in her pocket was the last miracle she could expect.</p><p> </p><p>Both her job and her home in Kansas were gone. She had no family and no one to go back to. She felt she'd had every reason for tossing her clothes into a suitcase and driving away from what had been, and what would have been, had she remained.</p><p> </p><p>She'd driven west simply because her car had been pointing in that direction and she'd taken it as a sign. She'd promised herself an adventure, a personal odyssey and a new, improved life.</p><p> </p><p>Reading about plucky young women who braved the world, carved a path, took risks and blithely accepted challenges was no longer enough. Or so she'd told herself as the miles had clicked away on the odometer of her ancient and sickly sedan. It was time to take something for herself, or at least to try.</p><p> </p><p>If she had stayed, she would have fallen in line. Again. Done what she was told. Again. And spent her life haunted by dreams and regrets.</p><p> </p><p>But now, one long week after sneaking out of town in the middle of the night like a thief, she wondered if she was destined for the ordinary. Perhaps she'd been born to follow all the rules. Maybe she should have been content with what life offered and kept her eyes cast down, instead of constantly trying to peek around the next corner.</p><p> </p><p>Gerald would have given her a good life, a life she knew many women would envy. With him, she could have had a lovely home tidily kept by a loyal staff, closets bursting with conventionally stylish wife&#x2013;ofthe&#x2013;executive clothes, a summer place in Bar Harbor, winter getaways to tropical climes. She would never be hungry, never do without.</p><p> </p><p>All it required was for her to do exactly as she was told, exactly when she was told. All it required was for her to keep buried every dream, every longing, every private wish.</p><p> </p><p>It shouldn't have been hard. She'd been doing it all of her life.</p><p> </p><p>But it was.</p><p> </p><p>Closing her eyes, she rested her forehead on the steering wheel. Why did Gerald want her so much? she wondered. There was nothing special about her. She had a good mind and an average face. Her own mother had described her just that way often enough. She didn't believe it was so much a physical attraction on Gerald's side, though she suspected he liked the fact she was a small woman of slight build. Easily dominated.</p><p> </p><p>God, he frightened her.</p><p> </p><p>She remembered how furious he'd been when she'd cut off her shoulder&#x2013;length hair, snipping away until it was as short as a boy's.</p><p> </p><p>Well, she liked it, she thought with a little spurt of defiance. And it was her hair, damn it, she added, pushing her fingers through choppily cut, toffeecolored locks.</p><p> </p><p>They weren't married yet, thank the Lord. He had no right to tell her how to look, how to dress, how to behave. And now, if she could just hold on, he never would have that right.</p><p> </p><p>She should never have agreed to marry him in the first place. She'd just been so tired, so afraid, so confused. Even though the regrets and the doubts had set in almost immediately, even though she'd given him back the ring and apologized, she might have gone through with it rather than stand up under his anger and live through the gossip of a broken engagement. But she'd discovered he'd manipulated her, that he was responsible for her losing her job, for the threat of eviction from her apartment.</p><p> </p><p>he'd wanted her to buckle. And she'd nearly obliged him, she thought now as she wiped sweat from her face with the back of her hand.</p><p> </p><p>The hell with it, she decided and pushed herself out of the car. So she had less than ten dollars, no transportation and a mile hike ahead of her. She was out from under Gerald's thumb. She was finally, at twentythree, on her own.</p><p> </p><p>Leaving her suitcase in the trunk, she grabbed the weighty tote that contained all that really mattered to her, then headed off on foot. She'd burned her bridges. Now it was time to see what was around that next corner. </p><p> It took her an hour to reach her destination. She couldn't have explained why she kept walking along Route 15, away from the scatter of motels, gas stations, and toward that shimmering Oz&#x2013;like skyline of Vegas in the distance. She only knew she wanted to be there, inside that globe of exotic buildings and shapes where lights were twinkling like a carnival.</p><p> </p><p>The sun was tipping down below the western peaks of the red mountains that ringed that glittering oasis. Her hunger had gone from grinding distress to a dull ache. She considered stopping for food, to rest, to drink, but there was something therapeutic about simply putting one foot in front of the other, her eyes on the tall, spectacular hotels glimmering in the distance.</p><p> </p><p>What were they like inside? she wondered. Would everything be glossy and polished, colorful to the point of gaudy? She imagined an atmosphere of sex and gambling, desperation and triumph, with an underlying snicker of naughtiness. There would be men with hard eyes, women with wild laughs. She'd get a job in one of those opulent dens of indulgence and have a front row seat for every show.</p><p> </p><p>Oh, how she wanted to live and see and experience. She wanted the crowds and the noise, the hot blood and the cold nerves. Everything, everything that was the opposite of what she'd had before. Most of all she wanted to feel&#x2014;strong, ripping emotions, towering joys, vivid excitement. And she would write about it all, she determined, shifting the tote which, filled with her notebooks and manuscript pages, weighed like stone. She would write, tucked in some little room looking out at it all.</p><p> </p><p>Stumbling with exhaustion, she tripped on a curb, then righted herself. The streets were crowded, everyone seemed to have somewhere to go. Even at dusk, the lights of the city winked and gleamed and beckoned: <i>Come in, take a chance, roll the dice.</i></p><p> </p><p>She saw families of tourists&#x2014;fathers in shorts with legs pink from the unforgiving sun, children with wide eyes, mothers with the frantic look of sensory overload.</p><p> </p><p>Her own eyes were wide, the golden brown glazed with fatigue. The man&#x2013;made volcano erupted in the distance, drawing screams and cheers from the crowd who'd gathered to watch and making Darcy gape with glassy&#x2013;eyed wonder. The noise smothered the odd buzzing in her ears as she was jostled by the crowd.</p><p> </p><p>Dazed and dazzled, she wandered aimlessly, gawking at the huge Roman statues, blinking at the neon, passing by the spurting fountains that gushed with shifting colors. It was a wonderland, loud and gaudy and unapologetically adult, and she was as lost and as fascinated as Alice.</p><p> </p><p>She found herself standing in front of twin towers as white as the moon and joined together by a wide, curved bridge with hundreds of windows. Surrounding the building were seas of flowers, both wild and exotic, and pools of mirror&#x2013;bright water fed by the rush of a terraced waterfall that tumbled from the topmost spear of a mountain.</p><p> </p><p>Guarding the entrance to the bridge was an enormous&#x2014;five times larger than life&#x2014;Indian war chief astride a gold stallion. His face and bare chest were gleaming copper. His war bonnet flowed with winking stones of rich reds and blues and greens. In his hand he carried a lance with a diamond&#x2013;bright tip that winked fire.</p><p> </p><p>He's so beautiful, was all she could think, so proud and defiant.</p><p> </p><p>She would have sworn the statue's dark eyes were alive, fixed on hers. Daring her to come closer, to go inside, to take her chances.</p><p> </p><p>Darcy stepped into The Comanche on watery legs and swayed against the sudden rush of cool air.</p><p> </p><p>The lobby was immense, the tile floors a bold geometric pattern of emerald and sapphire that made her head spin. Cacti and palms grew regally out of copper or pottery urns. Brilliant floral displays graced huge tables, the scent of the lilies so sweet it brought tears to her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>She walked on, amazed by the waterfall that rushed down a stone wall into a pond filled with bright fish, the sparkling light that shimmered from huge crystaland&#x2013;gold chandeliers. The place was a maze of color and flash, brighter and more brilliant than any reality she'd known or any dream she'd imagined.</p><p> </p><p>There were shops, the offerings in the windows as glittery as the chandeliers. She watched an elegant blonde debate between two diamond necklaces the way another might consider her choice of tomatoes.</p><p> </p><p>A laugh bubbled up in Darcy's throat, forcing her to press a hand to her mouth to hold it in. It wasn't the time or place to be noticed, she warned herself. She didn't belong in such glamorous surroundings.</p><p> </p><p>She turned the corner and felt her head reel at the sudden brassy sound of the casino. Bells and voices, the metallic rat&#x2013;a&#x2013;tat of coins falling on coins. Whirls and buzzes and hoots. The wave of energy pouring out brought a rush to her blood.</p><p> </p><p>Machines were everywhere, shoulder to shoulder with their faces spinning with colors and shapes. People crowded around them, standing, sitting on stools, pulling coins from white plastic buckets and feeding the busy machines. She watched a woman press a red button, wait for the spin to end, then scream with delight as triple black bars lined up in the center. Money poured out into a silver bowl in a musical rush.</p><p> </p><p>It made Darcy grin.</p><p> </p><p>Here was fun, reckless and impulsive. Here were possibilities both grand and small. And life, loud, messy and hot.</p><p> </p><p>She'd never gambled in her life, not with money. Money was something to be earned, saved and carefully watche...</p></p><h2>Blood+: Adagio, Vol. 2</h2><p>For the three hundred years that the Romanov dynasty has been in power, they have led Russia through an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity, but recent peasant uprisings and a sickly heir have destabilized this once-proud royal family.

The listener is driven to tears as she talks to Bessie about daily life without her. She weeps pitifully recalling Bessie&#39;s glorious garden and her many acts of kindness and then laughs heartily as she recalls Bessie&#39;s feistiness in the presence of Hillary Clinton and Bill and Camille Cosby. This is a truly moving performance. B.J.P. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineFrom Sadie, the surviving Delany sister, an inspiriting testimony to love and faith as she recalls life with Bessie and the challenge of learning to live on without her. With coauthor Hearth, who first brought the remarkable African-American Delany sisters to public attention in 1993 with their bestselling memoir Having Our Say, Sadie now describes the year following Bessie's death in September 1995. The two had been together since their distant childhood in North Carolina and all through the long remaining years in New York. As the older sister by two years, she never expected to survive Bessie: ``It doesn't seem natural that I outlived you . . . learning that I am a separate human being . . . for the first time in my life.'' But in the months ahead, Sadie does learn how to endure on her own and how to find pleasure in living. Summoning up the same religious faith that carried her through the worst excesses of Jim Crow legislation, she offers her memories of Bessie, and the conviction that Bessie is in heaven with their parents as a consolation for her grief. She punctuates her account of the passing year with comments on the flowers Bessie loved and cultivated in her garden, comforting quotations from the Bible, and what she's learned about life: ``To make the best of life, to keep trying, no matter what.'' But the same zest that made the sisters centenarian celebrities also enables Sadie to make a fulfilling life on her own. She starts writing this book, educates the young about the past, gives a party to celebrate Bessie's birthday, and is honored in turn on her 107th birthday. By the year's end, she's busy and content: ``Don't worry about me, Sister Bessie. Child, I've got plans.'' A bracing reminder from an exemplary teacher that life, a rare gift, must be savored in the living.

X. Toole was born in 1930. Having worked as a bullfighter, professional boxing "cut man," taxi driver, and saloon keeper, Toole published his first book of fiction at age seventy. He died in 2002, before seeing his short story "Million Dollar Baby" become an Academy Award-winning film.</p>The story of the 69-year-old author of this astonishing first fiction collection is a salutary one; he wrote between gigs tending boxers in their corners as a "cut man" (who stanches the blood flow and allows fights to continue), finally got a story published by a small literary magazine, was spotted by a keen-eyed agent and achieved book publication. It's amazing it took so long, because Irish-born Toole, now living and working in Los Angeles, is a natural. His knowledge of the bizarre world of professional boxing is encyclopedic and utterly persuasive, his prose is as tight as a well-laced pair of gloves and his protagonists, in this collection of five stories and a novella, are mythically heroic (and occasionally evil) but convincing archetypes. "The Money Look" is an exquisite turning-the-tables yarn at the expense of a cynical crook of a fighter; "Black Jew" is a telling tale of humble ambition woven with the lure of big money. A lacerating account of a courageous, deeply endearing hillbilly woman fighter and her sad fate, "Million $$$ Baby," is arguably the best story in the book. "Fightin' in Philly" is an almost equally moving tale of the toll the ambition to be a title fighter takes on a man. Another innocent torn up by the fight game is portrayed in "Frozen Water." Only the title novella, "Rope Burns," falls somewhat behind the sterling standard set by the other stories, with their firm authority and dead-on dialogue. It is more ambitious, even operatic, in its pitting of an almost superhumanly noble Olympic contender against a low-life East Los Angeles gang member at the time of the Rodney King riots. Like all of Toole's stories, it's breathlessly readable, even though the climactic bloodshed feels forced, as if Toole's cool narrative style cannot bear so much melodramatic freight. But make no mistake, the man is a heavyweight fiction contender. Agent, Nat Sobel. 6-city author tour.

Murray considered missions to be "the chief end of the church." Andrew pastored churches in Bloemfontein, Worcester, Cape Town and Wellington, all in South Africa. He was a champion of the South African Revival of 1860. In 1889, he was one of the founders of the South African General Mission (SAGM), along with Martha Osborn and Spencer Walton. After Martha Osborn married George Howe, they formed the South East Africa General Mission (SEAGM) in 1891. SAGM and SEAGM merged in 1894. Because its ministry had spread into other African countries, the mission's name was changed to Africa Evangelical Fellowship (AEF) in 1965. AEF joined with SIM in 1998 and continues to this day. He died on January 18, 1917, four months before his eighty-ninth birthday. Over the years he has influenced many, including Jessie Penn-Lewis, a key figure in the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival.</p><h2>Overcoming Spiritual Blindness</h2><p><p>All too often our modern society lacks both sight and insight resulting <br>from a refusal to see the reality of creation. Such lack of recognition <br>and appreciation for the Creator is spiritual blindness. Yet, the fruits<br>and evidence of His love and wisdom are clearly demonstrated<br>everywhere we look. Author Dr. James Gills, a world-renowned <br>ophthalmologist with a deep love of the Bible, writes about spiritual<br>blindness with stunning clarity and relevance.</p><p>This book illustrates a powerful biblical theme, often repeated <br>throughout the Scriptures: the analogy between the physical and the<br>spiritual realms regarding blindness and sight. From Isaiah&#x2019;s vision of<br>a day when God&#x2019;s Messiah would be &#x201c;a light for the Gentiles to open<br>eyes that are blind&#x201d; to the fulfillment of the prophecy when Paul was<br>sent to the Gentiles &#x201c;to open their eyes and turn them from darkness <br>to light, and from the power of Satan to God.&#x201d;</p><p>Overcoming Spiritual Blindness emphasizes the power and work of <br>the Holy Spirit. What the surgeon does for cataracts that hinder sight<br>in the physical eye, the Holy Spirit does for the cataracts of the heart.</p><p>Overcoming Spiritual Blindness exposes obstructions to spiritual <br>sight that cloud the lens of the soul. Such &#x201c;cataracts&#x201d; include pride,<br>misguided concepts of money, preoccupation with work, distorted views of sex, and a critical spirit. The description of &#x201c;the cataract of bitterness and an unforgiving spirit&#x201d; gives such powerful insight that the reader must gain a new perspective of total forgiveness. The list of spiritual cataracts is vast and painfully relevant, highlighting the need for spiritual surgery to those who do not realize they are blind.<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>James P.

And Cameron just might know more about it than he'd care to admit ...Involvement; connection; liability - Complicity is a stunting exploration of the morality of greed, corruption and violence, venturing fearlessly into the darker recesses of human purpose.</p><p>A distinguished judge who once extended leniency to a convicted rapist is himself brutally raped. A pornographer who specializes in snuff films is given a paralyzing injection while a video camera captures it on tape. A wealthy business-man whose negligence caused a fatal explosion is blown up in his own home. This series of savage, "punishment-fits-the-crime" assaults carried out by a self-styled avenger seems to implicate Cameron Colley, a latter-day Gonzo journalist who tries to put as much cheerful subversion into his dispatches for an Edinburgh-based newspaper as he can get away with. Detained by the police as a suspect, Cameron protests that he's being set up, but he cannot hide a certain complicit admiration for the avenger's violent justice. And Cameron knows the only way to get the cops off his back is to lead them to the vigilante himself--a good plan until it becomes clear that the culprit is uncomfortably close to home. Framing larger themes of crime and punishment around a chilling tale of murder and revenge, this brilliantly constructed thriller holds readers in its grip until its satisfying last pages, inviting them, too, to share Cameron's thrill as society's sheltered demons get their comeuppance. <i>Complicity</i> is Iain Bank's most compelling and exciting novel yet.<p></p><p>"[Banks is] a Nineties' Robert Louis Stevenson."--<i>The Independent On Sunday</i></p>Iain Banks came to widespread and controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, THE WASP FACTORY, in 1984.

Open your eyes! Open your ears! Let the divine life and light invade you so that your life is filled with aspiration, joy and hope.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2013;M. Basil Pennington &nbsp; At Our Lady of the Holy Spirit Monastery in Conyers, Georgia, Abbot Basil Pennington gave weekly talks to the monks on the Rule of Saint Benedict. Now, readers and listeners are able to sit and learn from one of the most important spiritual teachers of the last century. The talks have been lovingly transcribed and organized into book form, and they have also been exquisitely preserved on a single compact disk. &nbsp; &nbsp; This ancient Rule, written in the sixth century, continues to be a guide for men and women wishing to live a Christian life. Beginning with the prologue, Abbot Basil reads and comments on selected passages, providing the monks with insights into applying them in daily living. He takes the Latin phrases from the Rule and translates them into wisdom for the journey. Using his own monastic experiences, Basil illustrates how the Rule is more than a guide &#x2013; it is a way of life to be lived in love for Jesus Christ and in service to others.&nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Listen With Your Heart Compact Disc</i>&nbsp;(double CD)&nbsp;is&nbsp;the recorded version&nbsp;of M. Basil Pennington giving&nbsp;nine of the talks&nbsp;from which the book is transcribed.&nbsp;</p><p>The Following article appeared in the Boston Globe January 5, 2008 edition<br> Putting faith in a weight-loss plan<br><br> Rich Barlow<br><br> <p>Over the years, Renee Vigoroso has sampled a steady diet of diets. In an e-mail, she says she has tried "the banana diet, the grapefruit diet, the seven-day diet, the no-food diet, the skipping meals diet." </p><p>But she swears by the 3D plan, a pioneering faith-based eating program begun in 1972. Vigoroso, an administrator at Lexington's First Baptist Church, has been in 3D groups since 1976, treasuring the plan precisely because it is a nondiet diet, emphasizing a balanced relation with God, rather than being runway-model skinny. 3D (for diet, discipline, and discipleship) is "not life-denying and restrictive, as are other diets," writes Vigoroso, who lost 25 pounds on the plan. </p><p>Just in time for New Year's resolutions, two Cape Cod women - Carol Showalter , who invented 3D, and Maggie Davis, a Brewster dietician - have co-written a new book updating the plan. "Your Whole Life" , published by Paraclete Press, where Showalter works as a publicist, maintains the plan's original focus on the heavenly scales, not the ones in the bathroom. "The word diet does not actually mean losing weight," the authors write in their book. </p><p>They promise you will carve off those holiday pounds with faithful adherence to their program during the course of the 12-week regimen. It's just that 3D, with its mix of nutrition and exercise advice, daily biblical readings, suggested memorization of one short Scripture passage a week, diary keeping, and prayer has a more ambitious aim, the book says: "You work with God to bring your life under his will and guidance." </p><p>The collaboration between Showalter and Davis, begun six years ago, grew from a meeting of minds on nutrition and a synergy of souls on the role of spirituality in health. </p><p>Showalter was something of a spiritual entrepreneur in 1972, when she invented 3D decades before the slew of faith-based diets that have grown as numerous as the inches on the average American waistline. The wife of a Presbyterian minister and then living in Rochester, N.Y., she had long battled the bulge. In a joint interview with Davis, she said that church life exacerbated her problem, "which was getting overweight through stress, through emotional needs . . . and trying to be a perfect minister's wife" while raising four children. </p><p>Vacationing on the Cape in 1972, she heard a Christian speaker first mention diet in connection with the other two Ds as part of a Christian life. The notion was a thunderbolt to Showalter - why would God give a divine hoot about diet? - and she started the first 3D group at her church. </p><p>"It wasn't that I was preaching to everybody else that they had to have a spiritual dimension" to dieting, she recalled in the interview. "I had to have a spiritual dimension." </p><p>That jibed with the professional experience of Davis, to whom Showalter went for nutrition advice six years ago after having moved to the Cape. (Showalter says her weight remains an ongoing battle.) In 30 years of professional practice, Davis said, she has seen plenty of clients who need a spiritual component to inspire them in their eating program. </p><p>"I don't necessarily bring [spirituality] up in the first visit with a patient, but people make it very clear . . . that they do have a need to go deeper with this," Davis said. "Many people who have dealt with this lifelong find that tapping into whatever their spiritual system is - whether they be Jewish, Christian, atheist - there's a spiritual component that many of them find extremely helpful in gaining strength to make some of these crucial changes." </p><p>Most dieters gain back their weight a few years after losing it, and no studies have been done to confirm whether 3D is more effective.

Hyperion rushed the book into print earlier than the proposed publishing date; <i>60 Minutes</i> picked up the story and aired a debate on the authenticity of the diary itself; bookstores throughout the country are filling display-windows with copies of the book's handsome red-and-black cover. And then there's the evidence of the book itself. Whether or not this newly discovered diary of the Ripper is authentic--and the book makes a powerful argument that it is--the tale it tells is absolutely riveting. The suggestion is that the Ripper was actually a cotton merchant from Liverpool who, furious over his American wife's infidelity, went periodically to London to butcher whores who walked the streets close to where he had first seen his wife walking with her lover. The diary itself is either an elaborate and brilliant hoax authored early in the century (paper and ink dating have established that it is between 60 and 100 years old) or the genuine article. It is full of the sort of gruesome details that only someone with access to police records recently released could have known: for instance, that the Ripper took the heart of one of the victims home. The man himself, James Maybrick, was a drug addict who gradually became more and more unhinged throughout the authorship of his mad diary and ended up being murdered by his wife. From all angles, it is an extraordinary tale that, when accompanied by numerous arresting photographs and the text of the diary itself (in facsimile and in type), leaves one at the heart of a horrific and mesmerizing crime--one that somehow seems to define our terrible and frightening age. <i>Stuart Whitwell</i></p><h2>A Touch of Frost (DI Jack Frost series)</h2><p>The sleepy town of Denton has never known anything like the crime wave which now threatens to submerge it.

This astonishing book tells us that what was going on in there was life: loving, fighting, kindness, insanity, addiction, aspiration, terror, redemption everything that goes on in any human community but with the dual compressions of poverty and neglect.

Bypassing the official narrative of enlightened urban 'transformation' as well as the social scientific folklore and magical thinking about "mixed income communities" deployed to support it Audrey Petty has done something radical: she has simply and deeply listened to residents.

Scheiber, Dartmouth College</strong></p><p>Government regulation of the railroads is probably the most important example of federal intervention in the economy from the Civil War to World War I. It is also a key to an assessment of the impulses and motives behind Progressivism. In <em>Railroads and Regulation</em>, Gabriel Kolko presents a case study of the relationship of the economy to the political process in the United States during the years from 1877 to 1916.</p><p>The author discusses the extent to which the railroad industry encouraged and relied on national political solutions--such as the creation of the first significant federal regulatory agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission, in 1887--to its economic problems. He shows how this reliance created a pattern of interdependence between economic and political power that set a precedent for government regulation of the economy in the twentieth century. Drawing on new material and manuscript sources, Dr. Kolko describes the roles of the railroad men in the movement for federal regulation. The attitudes of the railroads toward regulation are placed in the broader context of the determination of governmental economic policies--policies frequently formulated in response to railroad pressure.</p><p>Dr. Kolko traces the continuity in governmental regulation between 1877 and 1900 and during the administration of Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson, with fresh material of Progressive leaders in the period from 1910 to 1916. He analyzes the origin of each major federal railroad act and the contending forces trying to shape the legislation, and gives an illuminating discussion of the relationship of the state and federal regulation.</p><p><em>Railroads and Regulation, 1877-1916</em> was awarded the Transportation History Prize of the Organization of American Historians.</p></p><p></p><h2>English Bread and Yeast Cookery (Revised)</h2><p>Describes the history of bread making, looks at various flours and meals, and shares recipes for breads, rolls, muffins, quiches, pancakes, dumplings, and doughnuts</p><p></p><h2>The Woman in the Veil: A Victorian Mystery</h2><p><b>Award-winning author Laura Joh Rowland is back with the fourth in her critically acclaimed Victorian mysteries where the case of a mutilated "Sleeping Beauty" washes ashore in London.</b><br><br>London, June 1890.<br><br>Sarah Bain and her friends Lord Hugh Staunton and Mick O'Reilly are crime scene photographers for the Daily World newspaper.

Wiley had selected these roughly 200 letters for publication, but the unfinished manuscript lay undiscovered for twelve years after the historian's death. The letters provide a rare glimpse of the two main theaters of war through the eyes of a general officer. Geary saw action at Cedar Mountain and Gettysburg in the Virginia theater and in the major campaigns in the west&#x2014;from lifting the siege at Chattanooga to marching with William T. Sherman through Georgia and the Carolinas.</p><p>The fascination Geary's letters held for Wiley, the quintessential scholar of the common person, is clear: the letters of an uncommon man reveal ordinary concerns about children, money, home, and religion that linked Geary to many on both sides of the war. Geary's letters also show another side of the officer, that of the consummate politician who knew that military service provided capital for future political campaigns. Through intense self-promotion, he had fashioned a reputation that served him well in gaining respected political posts both before and after the war: he fought in the Mexican War and served as the first mayor of San Francisco and as territorial governor of Kansas during the period known as "Bloody Kansas," in addition to winning two terms as governor of Pennsylvania after the war. Ultimately, the letters of John White Geary show how a political general plied his trade. They reveal the complexities of any historical figure, for Geary had both the admirable qualities of loyalty to the Union and the less attractive need to exaggerate his abilities to enhance his career.</p></p><p><p>William Alan Blair is an Assistant Professor of U.S. History at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Bell Irvin Wiley's classic books include <em>The Life of Billy Yank</em> and<em> The Life of Johnny Reb</em>.</p>From the book <p>Camp near Atlanta July 29th 1864 My Dearest Mary As usual I am writing you under a heavy cannonade. This is the fourth day of the siege, and throughout the live-long day the bursting of bombshells, the booming of Cannon, the rattling of small arms, the dead and the dying are features of the day and the night. But there are still worse features than these. War and pestilence I have witnessed, but my eyes have been spared until now from witnessing the emaciated and languid form of their skinny twin sister famine. To-day I saw a young mother with a starving child so poor as scarcely to live, seeking bread at our home. Her husband was a conscript in the rebel ranks, and this is but a specimen of Davis&#x2019; work. If there is one spot in hell hotter than another, why should it not be reserved for him who has brought such evils on his fellow man.</p></p><h2>Woman of Grace (Brides of Culdee Creek, Book 2)</h2><p>These classic historical romance novels are getting a new look for the next generation of readers.

With no cooperation from Costello, and apparently no means by which to contact his past or present associates for comment, Clayton-Lea scoured the press files again and again to fill his thin narrative. The result will fail to intrigue the uninitiated and will tell the committed fan little he or she doesn't already know. Given Costello's status as one of the most impressive and enduring music talents to emerge in the past quarter century, not to mention his many adventures on and off the job, this book must be counted as yet another failed attempt at telling his story. It doesn't help that Clayton-Lea's writing is sloppy and that some of the simplest facts--for instance, how much of "Less Than Zero" Costello and his band the Attractions played on the Christmas 1977 episode of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> before abandoning it for "Radio Radio"--escape his pages. (The author also sets a new record for misspellings of <i>King of America</i> coproducer T-Bone Burnett's name.) Clayton-Lea provides the reader plenty to argue with, but not in the manner of, say, Marcus Gray's entertaining, infuriating <i>Last Gang in Town: The Story and Myth of the Clash</i>. In fact, many lay fans' critical takes on Costello's work are bound to be more interesting than those of this supposed professional critic's. Hardly a must. <i>--Rickey Wright</i>Elvis Costello arrives at the end of the millennium generally recognized as one of the most important and influential stars of popular music, a figure of rare integrity in the music industry praised by artists as diverse as Paul McCartney, Tricky and Burt Bacharach. There are few songwriters who can match his output on an album-to-album basis, and perhaps none who can match his depth of passion and lyrical deftness. <p>Born in London in 1955 as Declan Patrick McManus, Elvis Costello left school at the age of 17. He worked as a computer operator by day and turned himself into a folk singer at night. His first album, released in 1977, My Aim Is True, was recorded during a series of "sick" days from work. Little short of breathtaking, it hit the charts becoming the biggest U.S. import album of the decade when it crossed the Atlantic on the CBS/Columbia label. On his first U.S. tour, when a clash with Stephen Stills and Bonnie Bramlet turned ugly, Costello flew back home with death threats ringing in his ears. In the twenty years since there have been twenty-three more albums that have made pop music history. Tony Clayton-Lea, an award winning music writer, tells the fascinating life story of the elusive icon -- the hits, the drugs, the drink, the women, the critics, and the record companies -- of the man who once said it was his ultimate vocation in life to be an irritant.</p></p><h2>Dance Anatomy (Sports Anatomy)</h2><p><p> Powerful, expressive, and compelling!

He lives in Lynchburg, Virginia.</p><p>Few studies have focused on the southern campaign of the Revolutionary War without clear bias. British accounts, while considerably more accurate in military detail, are slanted to protect the reputation of their officers, and most early provincial accounts demonstrate a position that lionizes local heroes. Historical records are scarce because few frontier militia members could read or write well. Here, James K.

Goaded by the British and threatened with destruction of their farms, the over-the-mountain men flocked to the support of the hard-pressed Colonial army. Their stellar individual contributions revealed here characterize the final and decisive campaign of the revolution.</p><p>The American Revolution evolved into a back country encounter when the principal British effort to subdue the Colonies moved to the southern provinces. After a series of significant American defeats, the hopes of a new nation seemed lost. The British having successfully captured the seaports of Savannah and Charles Town, Lord Charles Cornwallis determined to take the southern interior. With almost the entire army of the south defeated at the battle of Camden, back country militiamen set out from the hills of Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas to reverse American misfortunes and push their bitter enemies from their homeland. </p><p>In the winter of 1780-81, the most significant campaign, the turning point of the southern war, occurred in the Carolina back country. A trio of battles occurred within a five-month period at Kings Mountain, Cowpens, and Guilford Court House. These climactic clashes proved pivotal to American independence, destroying British army capability in the southern colonies. The British chose to withdraw and consolidate their forces at Yorktown.

Ed) (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>Situated on the narrow neck of land connecting the southern part of Greece with the north. Corinth was one of the most flourishing commercial centers of the ancient world. It was also a symbol of vilest debauchery. "In this hotbed of vice," Dr. Barclay narrates, illuminating the historical background of The Letters to the Corinthians, "some of the greatest work of Paul was done." The apostle wrote to the church there, partly to bolster its resistance to the sin and corruption, and equally to chide and counsel on the contentions that were tearing it apart. What, through the divine inspiration of his own remarkable faith, Paul said to the Corinthians now helps us, who live in the midst of the 21st century temptations and also suffer the evils of religious dissension.<br><br> In the simple, illustrative manner that has endeared him to thousands of students, Dr. Barclay clarifies every passage in Corinthians, making us feel with him that Paul's letters are, indeed, among the most fascinating documents in the New Testament.</p><p><b>William Barclay</b> (1907-1978) is known and loved by millions worldwide as one of the greatest Christian teachers of modern times.

These charts, drawn on parchment and crisscrossed with lines referring to the compass directions, indicated the succession of ports and anchorages along the shores, and were used by European sailors exploring the world up until the 18th century. </p><p> Not only used as navigational instruments on boats, they were also produced for wealthy sponsors in the form of illuminated images of the world, to illustrate the economic and political interests of the major European sea powers. </p><p> This book takes stock of the state of knowledge on these maps, bringing together contributions from a dozen European specialists, who trace the history and diversity of styles and places of production of these charts. </p><p> This type of mapping is approached from three angles. The first part, "The Mediterranean," refers to the manufacture and use of the first charts, centered on the Mediterranean, and the persistence of this tradition in the Mediterranean basin until the 18th century. </p><p> The second part, "The Open Sea," shows how these regional charts have evolved from a technical and iconographical point of view at the time of the great European voyages, in order to include the oceans and new worlds. </p><p> The third part, "The Indian Ocean," shows how these charts, in a maritime area where ancient civilizations coexisted, were dependent on other cartographic traditions (ancient, Arab, Asian) before joining the information reported by Portuguese sailors and European trading companies in the modern era. </p></p><p><p><b>Catherine Hoffman</b>, a paleographic archivist, is chief curator in the Department of Maps and Plans of the National Library of France.

The National Library of France (NLF), which has holdings of some 500 of these maps, mainly in the Maps and Plans Department, can boast of having a collection of exceptional quality, covering nearly all of the world and representing all the schools of cartography up to the 18th century. The library is undertaking a full census of these maps as well as taking stock of all rare maps in national public collections in France, so as to establish the value of this incalculable heritage, which is still largely unknown. Initial results are already available through its online library, <i>Gallica</i>, which shows all the holdings of the NLF, as well as those of the Historical Service of Defense. The NLF also wanted to open for public viewing a large exhibit of the most exceptional originals and the most representative examples of such documents. These were produced after the big discoveries by European navigators, and they provided Westerners the first glimpses of faraway lands and their people. These documents also underscored the dreams that fueled those extraordinary enterprises. </p><p> In this book, the library also offers a synthesis, in high-color resolution, of the accumulated knowledge -- thoroughly updated over the last 20 years -- of a cartography that was imbued with vitality and exceptional longevity. Originating in the ports of Majorca, Genoa or Venice, this cartography was embraced by Portuguese mariners who faced the challenges of transoceanic crossings. This also proved to be a valuable navigational tool for the European maritime powers of the time and was used until the end of the 18th century. The basis of the present work, a collaboration of about 15 European experts, was enriched by the results of research undertaken by the Mediterranean societies and of the Indian Ocean (MeDIan), financed by the National Research Agency and supported by the Department of Maps and Plans of the National Library of France. The program focuses on the exchange of knowledge between civilizations, and it has allowed us to showcase the role of these exchanges in the design and construction of a cartographic image of the Indian Ocean, from antiquity until the 18th century. Benefitting these blended approaches, <i>The Golden Age of Maritime Maps</i> provides a broad look at these rare maps and, through them, at the voyages, ideas and knowledge that led to a common view of the image of the modern world. </p><p> Bruno Racine<br> President of the National Library of France </p></p><h2>1,000 Playthinks: Puzzles, Paradoxes, Illusions &amp; Games</h2><p>1000 PLAYTHINKS is the most compulsive, head-scratching, and--at 5.08 pounds--gargantuan puzzle book ever.

She is the author of several critically acclaimed cookbooks including <em>Baking With Julia.<em> Her recipes and articles have appeared in <em>The New York Times, Bon Appetit, Food &amp; Wine,</em> and <em>Elle.</em></em></em>The title suggests the unthinkable: superindulgence in fare that has often been considered a frippery. Waffles can seem, quite appealingly, the stuff of childhood kitchens and adult narcoleptic Sundays. But Greenspan, a food journalist, tries to move waffles into the culinary mainstream, where they can serve a purpose at almost any meal, and in between. She discusses proper equipment, appropriate pantry purchases, unusual dietary considerations and how waffles can accommodate them, and what to do with waffles made ahead of time--freeze and microwave, mainly. Then the waffles themselves, in many incarnations: whole-grain sourdough, rocky road, mustard, zucchini-cheddar, rhubarb, chocolate-amaretti. There is a tiramisu waffle, a lemon meringue waffle and a white chocolate-chip variant--all lavish, as expected. And Greenspan doesn't neglect the childish sweet-tooth: one chapter is entitled "Just for Kids." So while it still seems unlikely, at the end of all, that anyone will actually grill up waffles for every meal, that possibility, as Greenspan presents it, is a pungent fantasy. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Let the Old Dreams Die</h2><p>This Book is Brand new international softcover edition delivered within 7-12 working days via UPS/USPS/DHL and FEDEX.(FOR SALE ONLY U.S. &amp; U.K.)</p><p>John Ajvide Lindqvist is a Swedish author, born in 1968.

From these dire opening lines, a delightful story of adventure begins. One family will emerge alive from this terrible storm: the Robinson's -- a Swiss pastor, his wife, and four sons, plus two dogs and a shipload of livestock, hens, pigeons and geese! Inspired by Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Cruesoe," this heartwarming tale portrays a family's struggle to create a new life for themselves on a strange and fantastic tropical island. There each boy must learn to control his own nature -- such as Ernest's bookishness and Fritz's hot temper -- as their adventures lead to amazing discoveries, danger, and tantalizing surprises, including a puzzling message tied to an albatross's leg. But it is the authenticity of the boys' behavior, the ingenuity of the family, and the natural wonders of this exotic land that have made <i>The Swiss Family Robinson</i>, first published in 1812-1813, one of the world's best-loved and most enduring stories of shipwreck and survival.Johann Wyss (1743&#x2013;1818) was a Swiss pastor who is best remembered for his book The Swiss Family Robinson. It is said that he was inspired by Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, but wanted to write a story from which his own children would learn, as the father in the story taught important lessons to his children. The Swiss Family Robinson was first published in 1812 and translated into English two years later. It has since become one of the most popular books of all time. The book was edited by his son, Johann Rudolf Wyss, a scholar who wrote the Swiss national anthem. Another son, Johann Emmanuel Wyss, illustrated the book.</p><h2>The Complete Natural Medicine Guide to Breast Cancer: A Practical Manual for Understanding, Prevention and Care</h2><p><p> Despite the risk of developing breast cancer, many women still have a limited knowledge of its causes and prevention. <b>The Complete Natural Medicine Guide to Breast Cancer</b> uses the most recent research studies and clinical evidence to explain the causes of breast cancer and techniques for its prevention. </p><p> Some of the topics covered are:</p><ul> <li>Comprehensive explanations for the causes of breast cancer -- hereditary, hormonal, environmental</li> <li>Identifiable environmental risks</li> <li>Self help detoxification programs, diet plans and herbal recommendations</li> <li>Natural medicine strategies which complement conventional medical treatments and promote recovery</li> <li>Psychological support</li> </ul><p></p><p> Protective factors are highlighted and valuable exercises and worksheets for breast care are included, such as The Breast Health Balance Sheet, an extensive questionnaire that helps to determine risk factors. </p><p> Written in an empathetic and accessible style, <b>The Complete Natural Medicine Guide to Breast Cancer</b> is an excellent resource for women seeking breast cancer information. </p></p><p><p> <b>Sat Dharam Kaur</b>, ND lectures on breast health at a naturopathic college and has a naturopathic practice specializing in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. She has a worldwide reputation as a teacher and activist and has been a featured speaker at The World Conferences on Breast Cancer. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> <b>A Call to Women</b> </p><p> In the fall of 1996 I began teaching the Healthy Breast Program because I felt it was necessary for women to become proactive in the prevention of breast cancer. From my studies of naturopathic medicine, I had some knowledge to share, and while I was a student, I had watched one friend in her early thirties die of breast cancer. My inability to help her at the time stimulated the writing of this book years later. </p><p> As I read more articles about breast cancer, I was not only astounded by the connection between the deteriorating environment and cancer development in our age but also angered by the cover-up of this knowledge. My passion to communicate this knowledge grew. I started to visualize women all over the world getting together in small groups -- supporting each other, educating each other, claiming their identities, preventing the disease in themselves, and taking an active role in preserving the environment. I felt inter-species grief resonating in my heart. The grief of mothers unable to nurse their young and unable to nurture themselves because the soil, the air, and the water have become inhospitable to life. The grief of bald eagles who see the shells of their offspring shatter unnaturally beneath their weight; the grief of St. Lawrence beluga whales dying of cancer, their carcasses hazardous waste because of the chemicals they contain. I heard the painful cries of future generations robbed of children because their hormones have been tampered with. It is the feminine principle, the right to raise offspring, that is being violated. The waters of life have been poisoned along with the earth and breath of Gaia. Breast cancer is the call to arms. Arms of action, arms of prayer, arms of holding and joining, arms held up in resistance to complacency, convenience, and denial, arms united. We each have two arms. Together we are one body. </p><p> This call to arms has many facets. Breast cancer reminds us that we must be honest with ourselves and in our relationships -- that we speak our truth and follow our inner guidance. Breast cancer draws the anger out of us -- anger at God, anger at ourselves for having surrendered pieces of our wholeness we must now retrieve, anger at the political, corporate, and industrial forces that have got us in to such an insane environmental mess, anger at the unconscious ease of convenience. The breast cancer epidemic offers us a path of purification that we sorely need. Each of us must choose when to plant our feet upon that path -- before or after a diagnosis. I believe that the only way out of the global breast cancer epidemic is through a path of purification. To me this includes honoring the soul and our unique abilities, being mindful of what and how we eat, releasing toxic emotions, cleansing the body, adopting a spiritual practice which is suited to our individual make-up, and realizing that it is our duty to make the environment safe and sacred once again. </p><p> It became clear to me as I was writing this book that we must shift from our present attitude of domination to cooperation and facilitation. We have been trying to dominate nature with our agricultural practices and it is making us, wildlife, and the planet sick. We have been trying to dominate the body with the overuse of antibiotics, the birth control pill, hormone replacement therapy, chemotherapy, and invasive treatments. The body has its own intelligence. It is much more fruitful to work with, rather than against, the body's processes: assist the liver in detoxification; enhance elimination with fiber and probiotics; balance the glands with herbs and meditation rather than cut them out, shut them down, or replace them with drugs; fortify the immune system with nutrition, herbs, visualization, and yoga before we immobilize it with chemotherapy and radiation. This is a naturopathic medical approach which recognizes the inherent ability of the body to heal itself when given the means to do so. </p><p> We have been trying to dominate each other with marketing hype and consumerism. The driving force behind domination is greed. Greed is destroying the Earth, our home, and destroying us. We must move from greed to living simply, realizing the consequences of our actions. What we do to the Earth, we do to ourselves. Breast cancer is evidence of that. Governments are not acting in the best interests of planetary ecology. We cannot rely on 'them' to take care of us or the earth. Industry continues to spew out billions more tons of chemicals each year into the environment while insisting that it does no harm. Countries explode nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants malfunction. There is no other Earth but the one we live on. Is there anywhere safe? Where can my children go? </p><p> Before we buy a product, we can consider how the air, earth, water, and wildlife were affected in the production of it, if it can be recycled or not, and whether it is safe to burn or bury. Most of the things we use are not. As our population expands, so does our toxic landfill. Before we eat our food, drink our water, and flush our toilets, we can ask these same questions. Then we do what we can to create positive change. We can accomplish a lot together. We are the guardians of the fertility of the Earth. All of us. </p><p> I feel a responsibility to do what I can in my own lifetime and to help others do the same. And so this book has been born. My prayer is that you will take it, use it yourself, share it with your daughters, sons, husbands, partners, friends, and lovers, teach someone else and perhaps start your own Healthy Breast Program. And that all over the world women will say no to food that is not organic, to plastic, to nuclear power, to chlorine, to anything that nature cannot take back into herself to nurture something else. We have broken the cycle of creation with our toxic waste. We must mend it. </p><p> Our immune systems resonate with the health of the planet. The planet is our collective body -- if she is sick, so are we. She is in our blood, our bones, our muscles, our organs. When I had my first child, I felt the earth split as my daughter entered the world. I felt the oceans in my breasts as they filled with milk. I was initiated into the mysteries of the earth. I have not forgotten. She is my mother. I believe that as conscious women, we can and must act as the white blood cells of the planet. Our bodies' immune systems are not separate from the earth's self-protective functions. We have loaded our Earth matrix with debris of every description that does not belong in her body -- nuclear fallout, plastics, plutonium, organochiorines, pesticides, chemical hormones, non-biodegradable landfill -- just as we must recognize and rid our bodies of toxins, so must she. The earth is our body too. Our bodies arise from the 'mater' of the earth and to the earth they will return. There is no separation. </p><p> Mankind has become the cancer of the earth as cancer has become the scourge of humanity. Where are the white blood cells of the earth? We find them in the environmentalists, the activists, the educators, the naturopaths and herbalists, the organic gardeners, the builders of windmills and solar energy units, the clean-up crews of environmental disasters. We are the 'cure' for this cancer. I invite each of you to become one of the white blood cells of the earth as you activate your own immune systems. Answer this call to women to act against the breast cancer epidemic by using some of your renewed energy to participate in healing the planet. We need one another to survive. We are the guardians of life and growing things. </p><p> I believe that women can turn things around. We stand united. We say no. We shall remain conscious rather than bowing to convenience. We hear the voices of the beluga whales, the polar bears, the Lake Apopka alligators, the Baltic seals, the bald eagles, Great Lakes salmon, and the voices of each other pressing us on, asking us to please help and act now. We act with the welfare of future generations of all species in our minds and hearts. We can and must make a</p></p><h2>Inside a Pearl: My Years in Paris</h2><p><p>When Edmund White moved to Paris in 1983, leaving New York City in the midst of the AIDS crisis, he was forty-three years old, couldn't speak French, and only knew two people in the entire city. But in middle age, he discovered the new anxieties and pleasures of mastering a new culture. When he left fifteen years later to take a teaching position in the U.S., he was fluent enough to broadcast on French radio and TV, and in his work as a journalist, he'd made the acquaintance of everyone from Yves Saint Laurent to Catherine Deneuve to Michel Foucault. He'd also developed a close friendship with an older woman, Marie-Claude, through which he'd come to understand French life and culture in a deeper way.</p><p>The book's title evokes the Parisian landscape in the eternal mists and the half-light, the serenity of the city compared to the New York White had known (and vividly recalled in <i>City Boy</i>). White fell headily in love with the city and its culture: both intoxicated and intellectually stimulated. He became the definitive biographer of Jean Genet; he wrote lives of Marcel Proust and Arthur Rimbaud; and he became a recipient of the French Order of Arts and Letters. <i>Inside a Pearl </i>recalls those fertile years for White. It's a memoir which gossips and ruminates, and offers a brilliant examination of a city and a culture eternally imbued with an aura of enchantment.</p></p><p><b>Edmund White</b> is the author of two previous memoirs, <i>My Lives</i> and <i>City Boy</i>, and a previous book on Paris, <i>The Fl�neur</i>.His many novels include the autobiographical <i>A Boy's Own Story</i> and, most recently,<i> Jack Holmes &amp; His Friend</i>.

By the author of The Light Years. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>Elizabeth Jane Howard was the author of fifteen highly acclaimed novels. The Cazalet Chronicles - The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion, Casting Off and All Change - have become established as modern classics and have been adapted for a major BBC television series and for BBC Radio 4. In 2002 Macmillan published Elizabeth Jane Howard&#39;s autobiography, Slipstream. In that same year she was awarded a CBE in the Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours List. She died, aged ninety, at home in Suffolk on 2 January 2014.Lush, sprawling escapist fiction of the first order, the third installment of the Cazalet Chronicle opens in the spring of 1942 and continues the saga begun in The Light Years and Marking Time. Set in London and the English countryside, much of the story focuses on the eldest Cazalet cousins, Louise, Polly and Clary, as they exit their teens and take their first steps into adulthood. Former acting student Louise has been swept into a brilliant but chilly marriage to Michael Hadleigh, a glamorous portrait painter and aspiring Member of Parliament whose life is controlled by his powerful mother. Best friends Polly and Clary leave the cozy confines of the Cazalet's country home to begin what they hope will be terribly grown-up lives in London. While Polly mourns the recent death of her mother, Clary keeps a journal that she hopes to give to her father, who has been missing since the invasion of Normandy. Alternating with the cousins' stories are chapters devoted to the rest of the Cazalet clan, their friends and lovers, bringing readers up to date on the doings of adulterous Edward, his dutiful spinster sister Rachel, her loving best friend Margot Sidney and others. Howard creates a nearly palpaple world, peopled with the sort of well-conceived characters that linger long in the reader's mind. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 Omnibus Volume 1</h2><p>Series creator Joss Whedon brought <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer </i>back to life with this comics-only follow-up to Season 7 of the television show.

Yet during that perilous time, many Jews found refuge in an unlikely place--the sprawling complex of the Grand Mosque of Paris. Not just a place of worship but a community center, this hive of activity was an ideal temporary hiding place for escaped prisoners of war and Jews of all ages, especially children. <br><br>Beautifully illustrated and thoroughly researched (both authors speak French and conducted first-person interviews and research at archives and libraries), this hopeful, non-fiction book introduces children to a little-known part of history. Perfect for children studying World War II or those seeking a heart-warming, inspiring read that highlights extraordinary heroism across faiths.<br><br>Includes a bibliography, a recommended list of books and films, and afterword from the authors that gives more details behind the story.</p><p>Karen Gray Ruelle is a decorated author who has written over 20 children&#x2019;s books. <br><br>Deborah Durland DeSaix, a former college professor, has written and illustrated many picture books for children. Reviews for her artwork are outstanding.

While they admit that "many of the details are destined to remain forever uncertain, with few facts proven to a historian's satisfaction," Ruelle and DeSaix feel strongly that the bits and pieces of information that they were able to unearth provide convincing evidence that the Muslims of the Grand Mosque of Paris saved Jewish lives. While the format and appearance of this title are similar to other picture books of rescue and resistance during the Holocaust, such as Carmen Agra Deedy's <i>The Yellow Star</i> (Peachtree, 2000) and Ken Mochizuki's <i>Passage to Freedom</i> (Lee &amp; Low, 1997), the text provides more of a descriptive history of events than a retelling of a story.

Not only has he signed and nurtured more important artists than anyone alive, now sixty years in the game, he's still the hippest label head, travelling the globe in search of the next big thing. </p><p>Since the late fifties, he's been wherever it's happening: Billboard, Tin Pan Alley, The British Invasion, CBGB, Studio 54, Danceteria, the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame, the CD crash. Along that winding path, he discovered and broke out a skyline full of stars: Madonna, The Ramones, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode, Madonna, The Smiths, The Cure, Ice-T, Lou Reed, Seal, and many others.</p><p>Brimming with hilarious scenes and character portraits, <i>Siren Song</i>&#x2019;s wider narrative is about modernity in motion, and the slow acceptance of diversity in America &#x2013; thanks largely to daring pop music.

Stein wonderfully captures his obsessive love for the bruising music business and introducing music-lovers to new bands&#x2015;and not going deaf or broke in the process." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><i></i><br>"Intertwined with behind-the-scenes tales of mayhem and craziness of the 1970s and '80s, Stein weaves down-to-earth storytelling about his Jewish upbringing in 1950s Brooklyn and his childhood fascination with Coney Island and how it stoked his young imagination, leading to his future life in music. A sometimes-gritty, sometimes-charming memoir that pays tribute to the American recording industry." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Stein, the entrepreneur who is generally credited as being the man who launched the punk/new wave movement (on his own label, Sire Records), recounts his life story in this entertainingly written, conversational book. This is a fun book, full of behind-the-music-scenes stories and personal anecdotes that capture the rockin&#x2019; spirit of the 1970s, &#x2019;80s, and beyond.

A revealing assisted autobiography about a man who 'learned how to harness my mad, hungry dissatisfaction into rocket fuel'." &#x2015;<i>Irish Times</i></p><p>"Seymour is the man with the golden ears, who brings an encyclopedic knowledge of music, and an bohemian joie de vivre to his work finding exciting new talent in the most unlikely places." &#x2015;k.d. lang</p><p>"In addition to being a world famous record man, Seymour Stein was wilder than most of the musicians he worked with. Thankfully, he has survived to tell his tale and what a tale it is! We are very pleased and grateful to have been part of his amazing story." &#x2015;Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth</p><p>"Seymour Stein told me &#x2018;I don't totally understand what you're doing (as far as Rap music) but I know it's important.&#x2019; That's the day I realized &#x201c;smart&#x201d; people will know something is THERE even if they're not sure what it is. That vibe he felt launched my career." &#x2015;Ice T</p><p> &#x201c;It was an ambition of mine to sign The Smiths to Sire Records. We wanted to be like our heroes, but most of all it was about working with Seymour Stein.

He is like Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark, but instead of the ark, he has been in search of that artist or song that would change our lives forever.

The drapes were drawn, the gaslights turned down. A film projector clicked and whirred, its beam of light focused on the far wall like the great eye of a cyclops.<br> <br>President Woodrow Wilson, the twenty-eighth president of the United States, and his cabinet members and their families had gathered together to watch the first movie ever shown in the White House. The movie was called The Birth of a Nation. It was directed by D. W. Griffith.<br> <br>The three-hour-long movie was a black-and-white silent film; it had no spoken dialogue. Actors used gestures and pantomime to convey what they wanted to say. During key moments, title cards summarized the action. In short, The Birth of a Nation was a story told without words.<br> <br>Woodrow Wilson and the rest of the moviegoers that night didn&#x2019;t need words. They knew the setting, the characters, and the plot. They knew the good guys&#x2014;and the villains. The movie was based on a popular book called The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan, a novel written by a Southern white Baptist minister named Thomas Dixon Jr.<br> <br>Using the worst racial stereotypes, Dixon tells a story that encompasses the antebellum South, the Civil War, Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination, Reconstruction, and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. The heroic Klansmen gallop in to rescue helpless white Southern women from the clutches of lustful black men.<br> <br>Dixon claimed that his novel was the &#x201c;true story of the Ku Klux Klan conspiracy that overturned the Reconstruction government.&#x201d; But it was the exact opposite of the truth, and the president of the United States was screening it in the nation&#x2019;s capital.<br><br><br> <br>Movie poster for The Birth of a Nation.<br> <br> The Facts of Reconstruction and the Ku Klux Klan<p></p> <br>The actual record of Reconstruction and the Ku Klux Klan reveals a different story: The Ku Klux Klan formed in Tennessee in 1866, one year after the Civil War ended. Soon Klan groups spread across the South. Its members committed themselves to the use of physical violence in order to maintain white supremacy and violate the civil rights of others.<br> <br>The Klan attacked&#x2014;and killed&#x2014;black Americans who dared to speak out and who exercised their right to earn a living, buy land, attend school, worship as they pleased, and vote (a right granted to black men nationwide in 1870 by the Fifteenth Amendment). They attacked and killed white Americans who supported the rights of black Americans and who didn&#x2019;t vote the way the Klan wanted.<br> <br>The Klan&#x2019;s first wave of violence swept over the South from 1866 through 1871. That year, the federal government sent troops to arrest Klansmen and restore peace. For eight months, a joint committee of US senators and representatives investigated. They gathered testimonies, held trials, and handed down sentences.<br><br><br> <br>Two members of the Ku Klux Klan in their disguises.<br><br>But it was too little too late. Most of the arrested Klansmen paid small fines and received minimal sentences. Many received suspended sentences and a warning. Often charges were simply dropped. Some Klansmen went into hiding or fled to avoid punishment. Many were pardoned.<br> <br>By 1872, the federal government succeeded in breaking up the Klan, but it couldn&#x2019;t dissolve white supremacists&#x2019; commitment to control elections and the lives of African Americans. That commitment led to the resurgence of the Klan in the 1920s in reaction to foreign immigration, and again in 1960 as a reaction to the civil rights movement.<br> <br>Dixon&#x2019;s novel and D. W. Griffith&#x2019;s movie adaptation of it ignored the brutal realities of the Ku Klux Klan. Instead, the Klansmen were portrayed as noble white-robed knights who reluctantly took the law into their own hands in order to rescue white Southerners, especially &#x201c;helpless&#x201d; white women, from racial violence and what whites termed &#x201c;Negro rule.&#x201d;<br> <br>This view of history is false. Southern white women were not helpless. They showed physical and emotional strength as they worked and managed businesses and farms while their husbands, fathers, and sons fought in the war.<br> <br>&#x201c;Negro rule,&#x201d; or the notion that the newly freed and enfranchised black Americans would dominate and rule over white Americans, was true only in the wild imaginations of fearful whites&#x2014;and perhaps in the wistful imaginations of black Americans who yearned to more fundamentally upset American racial hierarchy.<br> <br>The Birth of a Nation premiered in Los Angeles and opened to a packed house at New York&#x2019;s Liberty Theater on March 3, 1915. Soon the popular film opened in theaters across the country. African Americans who attended the movie deplored the ugly portrayal of the freed people&#x2014;those who could have very well been their parents or grandparents&#x2014;as lawless, ignorant, amoral, lecherous, and violent characters.<br> <br>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) protested the movie vociferously. It cataloged the film&#x2019;s numerous falsehoods and attempted to educate the public about the dire circumstance blacks faced in the post&#x2013;Civil War South.<br> <br>Despite the protests and educational campaigns&#x2014;and despite the blatant disregard for the historical record&#x2014;the film became a phenomenal box-office hit.<br> <br>In 1915, the film inspired a group of white Southern men to climb to the top of Stone Mountain in Georgia and burn a cross. With this cross burning, the Ku Klux Klan, disbanded since 1872, rose again. The Klan used the movie to launch a recruiting campaign. Soon the group spread throughout the United States, and membership exploded to more than five million.<br> <br>The second wave of Klansmen renewed the fight to maintain white supremacy throughout the United States. They portrayed themselves as a pro-Christian, pro-American brotherhood. They added Catholics, Jews, immigrants, liberals, welfare recipients, and labor unions to their list of hated targets.<br> <br>That same year, 1915, fifty-six blacks and thirteen whites were lynched. Five were women.<br> The Embellished History<p></p> <br>Woodrow Wilson sat in the darkened Central Hall, watching the closing scenes of The Birth of a Nation. In these scenes, Ku Klux Klan members ride in on their horses to rescue a poor white family from corrupt federal soldiers. The Klansmen take guns away from the freedmen and intimidate black voters at the polls. In this way, the Klansmen believe they have restored peace to South Carolina. The movie&#x2019;s final title card appears: Liberty and union, one and inseparable, now and forever.<br> <br>After the final credits, the film projector whirred and clicked to the end of the reel. Someone must have asked the president what he thought about the movie, because an enthusiastic Wilson reportedly said, &#x201c;It is like writing history with Lightning and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.&#x201d;<br> <br>Except it wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>It was all so terribly untrue.<br> <br>How did such a movie, one filled with so much misinformation disguised as fact, make its way to the White House? And, perhaps more disturbing, why did the president of the United States, a man with a PhD from Johns Hopkins University who went on to become president of Princeton University, accept the film&#x2019;s version of history so easily?<br> <br>President Wilson screened The Birth of a Nation as a personal favor to his close friend Thomas Dixon Jr. The president was also a historian who wrote many works, including the five-volume A History of the American People, published in 1902, and The New Freedom: A Call for the Emancipation of the Generous Energies of a People, published in 1913. This latter work, The New Freedom, served as a cornerstone to his presidential campaign.<br> <br>There is little doubt that the story told in The Birth of a Nation appealed to Woodrow Wilson, given his strong Southern heritage. The son of a Presbyterian minister, Wilson was born in Virginia in 1856 and was raised in Georgia and South Carolina. He was old enough to appreciate the horrors of a war that left at least 750,000 soldiers dead on both sides and one million wounded.<br> <br>Like his Southern forebears, Wilson grew up to regret the war&#x2019;s outcome and the radical changes it brought&#x2014;namely, the freedmen&#x2019;s right to vote and receive equal protections under the law.<br> <br>During his presidential campaign, Wilson pledged to support justice for black Americans. &#x201c;Should I become President of the United States they may count upon me for absolute fair dealing for everything by which I could assist in advancing the interests of their race.&#x201d;<br> <br>To many African Americans, Wilson betrayed that promise after his inauguration when, in line with Jim Crow laws that had separated blacks from whites since 1876, he too encouraged the separation of races. Although federal agencies were not segregated and black and white employees had worked side by side in the same offices for more than fifty years, Wilson permitted the offices of the Postmaster General, the Treasury, and the US Navy to separate black workers from white workers.

Early the following decade he left for Kuwait, embarking on a thirty-year career that would see his cartoons published daily in newspapers from Cairo to Beirut, London to Paris. <br><br>Resolutely independent and unaligned to any political party, Naji al-Ali strove to speak to and for the ordinary Arab people; the pointed satire of his stark, symbolic cartoons brought him widespread renown. Through his most celebrated creation, the witness-child Handala, al-Ali criticized the brutality of Israeli occupation, the venality and corruption of the regimes in the region, and the suffering of the Palestinian people, earning him many powerful enemies and the soubriquet &#x201c;the Palestinian Malcolm X.&#x201d; <br><br>For the first time in book form, <i>A Child in Palestine</i> presents the work of one of the Arab world&#x2019;s greatest cartoonists, revered throughout the region for his outspokenness, honesty and humanity. <br><br><i>&#x201c;That was when the character Handala was born. The young, barefoot Handala was a symbol of my childhood. He was the age I was when I had left Palestine and, in a sense, I am still that age today and I feel that I can recall and sense every bush, every stone, every house and every tree I passed when I was a child in Palestine. The character of Handala was a sort of icon that protected my soul from falling whenever I felt sluggish or I was ignoring my duty. That child was like a splash of fresh water on my forehead, bringing me to attention and keeping me from error and loss. He was the arrow of the compass, pointing steadily towards Palestine. Not just Palestine in geographical terms, but Palestine in its humanitarian sense&#x2014;the symbol of a just cause, whether it is located in Egypt, Vietnam or South Africa.&#x201d;</i>&#x2014;Naji al-Ali, in conversation with Radwa Ashour</p><p><b>Naji Salim al-Ali </b>(1938&#x2013;87) was a Palestinian cartoonist, noted for the political criticism in his work. He drew over 40,000 cartoons, which often reflected Palestinian and Arab public opinion and were sharply critical commentaries on Palestinian and Arab politics and political leaders. He is perhaps best known as creator of the character Handala, pictured in his cartoons as a young witness of the satirized policy or event depicted, and who has since become an icon of Palestinian defiance. Naji al-Ali was shot by unknown assailants outside the offices of &#x201c;al-Qabas&#x201d;, a Kuwaiti newspaper in London on July 22, 1987 and died 5 weeks later.<br><br><b>Joe Sacco</b> lives in Portland, Oregon.

For the first time, Western readers are beckoned into Palestinian lives by the graphic warmth, inspiration and horror of the cartoonist Naji al-Ali, whose iconic Hanthala is our witness and conscience, imploring, rightly, that we never forget.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Pilger</p><h2>Myths, Lies, and Half Truths of Language Usage</h2><p>Conventional wisdom suggests English is going to the dogs, that bad grammar, slang, and illogical constructions signal a decline in standards of usage - to say nothing of the corruption wrought by email and text messages. But English is a complicated, marvelous language. Far from being a language in decline, English is the product of surprisingly varied linguistic forces, some of which have only recently come to light. And these forces continue to push English in exciting new directions. These 24 eye-opening lectures dispel the cloud of confusion that clings to English, giving you a crystal-clear view of why we use it the way we do and where it fits into the diverse languages of the world. Like an archaeologist sifting through clues to a vanished civilization, you&#39;ll uncover the many features of English that sound normal to a native speaker but that linguists find puzzling and also revealing. For example, the only languages that use &#34;do&#34; the way English does (as in &#34;do not walk&#34;) are the Celtic languages such as Welsh, which were spoken by people who lived among the early English and influenced their language in many subtle ways. You&#39;ll also delight in considering modern controversies about how English is used. For example, &#34;Billy and me went to the store&#34; is considered incorrect, because the subject form, &#34;I,&#34; should be used instead of &#34;me.&#34; But then why does &#34;Me and Billy went to the store&#34; sound so much more fluent than &#34;I and Billy went to the store&#34;? These examples and many more represent a few of the flash points in English&#39;s long history of defying rules, a process that occurs in all languages. You&#39;ll come away from this course with every reason to be a proud, informed, and more self-aware speaker of English.</p><p></p><h2>School Crisis Prevention and Intervention</h2><p>Effectively dealing with a school crisis requires a cohesive multidisciplinary team and a comprehensive plan that encompasses prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.

He originally intended to become a doctor and earned his degree before turning to what was then a medium for children. His many early masterpieces include the series known in the U.S. as <i>Astro Boy</i>. With his sweeping vision, deftly interwined plots, feel for the workings of power, and indefatigable commitment to human dignity, Tezuka elevated manga to an art form. The later Tezuka, when he authored Buddha, often had in mind the mature readership that manga gained in the sixties and that had only grown ever since. The Kurosawa of Japanese pop culture, Osamu Tezuka is a twentieth century classic."Infused with humor and history, the epic of Siddhartha is perhaps Osamu Tezuka's crowning acheivement and illustrates why, without irony, Tezuka is referred to as 'The King of Japanese Comics'." -<b><i> LA Weekly</i></b>"Buddha is one of Tezuka's true masterpieces. We're lucky to have this excellent new edition in English." - <b><i>Scott McCloud</i></b>, author of <i>Understanding Comics</i>"In handsome volumes designed by Chip Kidd, the Vertical books present Tezuka at his best." - <b><i>National Post<br></i></b><br>"<i>Buddha</i> is an engrossing tale. The armchair philosopher, the devout Buddhist, the casual manga fan - this book satisfies all with its tale of humanism through sequential art, and definitely earns its place on a bibliophile's bookshelf." -<b><i>Anime Insider</i></b>"This is one of the greatest acheivements of the comics medium, a masterpiece by one of the greats." -<b><i>Artbomb.net</i></b>"In Tezuka's world, the exquisite collapses into the goofy in a New York minute, the goofy into the melodramatic, the melodramatic into the brutal, and the brutal into the sincerely touching. The suprising result is a work wholly unique and downright fun." -<b><i>Time Out NY</i></b><i>"</i>Tezuka's Buddha is a striking and memorable confluence of ancient wisdom and contemporary popular art." -<b><i>Yoga Journal<br><br></i></b></p><h2>September in the Rain: The Life of Nelson Riddle</h2><p>Nelson Riddle will forever be linked with the music and recordings of such unforgettable vocalists as Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Bing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney, and dozens of others.

Levinson</b> is the author of <i>Trumpet Blues: The Life of Harry James</i>. He worked for 42 years in the entertainment business as a publicist, freelance writer, booking agent, and personal manager. He lives in Malibu, California.In this entertaining biography, Levinson (Trumpet Blues: The Life of Harry James) highlights Riddle's song-writing accomplishments that had singers topping the charts. By 1953, Levinson writes, "the only thing about Frank Sinatra that sparkled was the superb cap job done on his teeth ten years earlier" record sales plummeted, his TV show was canceled, and MGM dropped him. But his career took on new life and artistic depth after he recorded a series of albums with Riddle, whose intelligent, seductive arrangements have become American classics. Aside from Sinatra, Riddle worked with Nat "King" Cole (on almost all of his most famous singles) and Ella Fitzgerald (in her American Songbook collections), as well as with Judy Garland, Rosemary Clooney and Johnny Mathis. He scored such films as the original Ocean's 11, Can-Can and The Great Gatsby, for which he received an Oscar. Levinson, a longtime friend of Riddle and a respected jazz publicist, meticulously narrates Riddle's often strife-torn personal life and charts the importance and enormous breadth of the arranger's career. While the narrative covers salient aspects of Riddle's life (his relationship with his cold, autocratic mother, his affair with Rosemary Clooney, the disintegration of his once-happy marriage and an underlying depression throughout his life), Levinson's analysis of his work and the music industry give the book both its vitality and enormous value. Always lively and written with a deep understanding of the economic, political and emotional complexities of the music business, this is an important addition to the history of American popular culture. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>When You&#39;ve Been Wronged: Moving From Bitterness to Forgiveness</h2><p><p><b>You&#x2019;ve been wronged.</b></p><p>Have lies have been told about you?

This book is full of rich, biblical insight and practical instruction which, if heeded, will prove to be the pathway to freedom and perhaps the revival we so desperately need.</i>&nbsp;<br>-Nancy Leigh DeMoss, Author, Revive Our Hearts radio host</p></p><h2>The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction</h2><p>At a public picnic in the South in the 1890s, a young man paid five cents for his first chance to hear the revolutionary Edison talking machine. He eagerly listened as the soundman placed the needle down, only to find that through the tubes he held to his ears came the chilling sounds of a lynching. In this story, with its blend of new technology and old hatreds, genteel picnic and mob violence, Edward Ayers captures the history of the South in the years between Reconstruction and the turn of the century--a combination of progress and reaction that defined the contradictory promise of the New South.<br> Ranging from the Georgia coast to the Tennessee mountains, from the power brokers to tenant farmers, Ayers depicts a land of startling contrasts--a time of progress and repression, of new industries and old ways. Ayers takes us from remote Southern towns, revolutionized by the spread of the railroads, to the statehouses where Democratic "Redeemers" swept away the legacy of Reconstruction; from the small farmers, trapped into growing nothing but cotton, to the new industries of Birmingham; from abuse and intimacy in the family to tumultuous public meetings of the prohibitionists. He explores every aspect of society, politics, and the economy, detailing the importance of each in the emerging New South. Here is the local Baptist congregation, the country store, the tobacco-stained second-class railroad car, the rise of Populism: the teeming, nineteenth-century South comes to life in these pages. And central to the entire story is the role of race relations, from alliances and friendships between blacks and whites to the spread of Jim Crow laws and disenfranchisement. Ayers weaves all these details into the contradictory story of the New South, showing how the region developed the patterns it was to follow for the next fifty years.<br> When Edward Ayers published <em>Vengeance and Justice</em>, a landmark study of crime and punishment in the nineteenth-century South, he received wide acclaim. Now he provides an unforgettable account of the New South--a land with one foot in the future and the other in the past.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Edward Ayers</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Virginia and is the author of <em>Vengeance and Justice</em>.<br>"Best books of 1992--Library Journal<br><br>"Thanks to its extraordinary vitality, Origins of the New South is the monument that towers behind Edward Ayers's Promise of the New South; it is also a monument that Ayers's exciting new book is bound to replace.

This best-selling classic records the experiences of Dr. Graham and others who are convinced that at moments of special need they have been attended by angels. With keen insight and conviction, Dr. Graham affirms that:</p><p></p><ul><li>Gods invisible hosts are better organized than any of the armies of man&#x2014;or Satan.</li><li>Angels think, feel, will, and display emotions.</li><li>Angels guide, comfort, and provide for people in the midst of suffering and persecution.</li><li>At death, the faithful will be ushered by angels into the presence of God.</li></ul><p></p><p></p></p><p><i>Angels: God's Secret Agents</i> is Billy Graham's one-volume introduction to one of the most popular spiritual phenomena of our time. Firmly grounded in Graham's close readings of scripture, <i>Angels</i> testifies to Graham's own encounters with the heavenly beings and also records the many similar stories that other believers have told him over the years. Graham devotes entire chapters to the questions of whether angels are visible or invisible, how they differ from men and women, and how the angelic hierarchy is organized. He also discusses the much-debated theory that UFO sightings are in fact angelic appearances. <p> Perhaps the primary purpose of this book, however, is to inform readers that armies of angels are ready and willing to help Christians in their daily fights against the forces of darkness. "Millions of angels are at God's command and at our service," Graham writes. "The hosts of heaven stand at attention as we make our way from earth to glory, and Satan's BB guns are no match for God's heavy artillery." Such stirring theological pronouncements are matched with practical advice for believers who wish to know the angelic powers in everyday life. <i>--Kevin Attwood</i></p>Relating his personal experiences, Graham helps to call a world in crisis to faith.</p><h2>The All-New Tenchi Muyo!

If you are of the school of thought that "treats are fine for training tricks but I have a dog that bites," you owe yourself a serious study of the techniques and theory in "Dogs Are From Neptune". <p>Nowhere else is the case made more strongly for positive reinforcement training for the resolution of serious problems, not simply from the standpoint of dog and handler-friendliness, but from that of efficacy and deep, permanent change. </p><p>"Dogs Are From Neptune" draws from real cases to provide clear, step-by-step advice for troubleshooting problems from obedience proofing stumpers to serious biters and fighters. Many of the owners presenting histories had made the rounds of trainers and behaviorists with no improvement prior to submitting their cases. </p><p>There is a comprehensive and enlightening discussion of the finer points of classical and operant conditioning and why the former may indeed "over-ride" the latter when dealing with aggression. Donaldson has treated innumerable aggressive dogs and has an excellent ability to tease out key features in each case history. Her description of "Suburban Dog Syndrome" rings true for dog people everywhere. Perhaps most ground-breaking are her discussions of dog bullying, fighting and defensive aggression. </p><p>The first three sections cover aggression, towards strangers, family members and other dogs. The aggression to strangers section contains a case of "socialization omission," to men specifically; a more globally aggressive dog with many triggers, a dog on the comeback trail from a bad beginning in life, a therapy dog with a good history that begins growling at certain people and the case of an exasperated family who feel they have a genetic misfit. </p><p>The aggression to family members section, entitled "Resource Guarding" gives step-by-step plans for and background on food and object possessiveness as well as a beautifully structured treatment protocol for a dog that will not allow routine handling. </p><p>In the dog-aggression section, the topics are reactivity to proximity, chronic fighting in a dog park, a dog that begins growling after a couple of bad experiences at class, a how-to on handling a dog that bullies other dogs, understanding inter-bitch aggression, the owner's role in dog to dog aggression problems and an extremely convincing case for the use of food in the treatment of aggression. </p><p>The second half of the book involves cases of behavior and obedience problems and anxiety-related disorders. Counter-surfing, dirt, stool and garbage eating, amusing and informative cases of barking, pushy play-biting in a full-grown dog, sofa-elimination and its likely motives and a mounting Labrador bitch round out the behavior problems section. </p><p>The obedience problems range from new insights into garden variety presentations such as pulling on leash, heeling, jumping up and controlling dogs off leash to the more esoteric context-specific stay-breaking, obedience-ring sluggishness and the relative merits of electric shock and non-aversive approaches to undoing a squirrel hunter. </p><p>The fear and anxiety section encompasses both mild and severe separation anxiety, anxiety about traffic in general and about getting into cars and a fascinating case of a dog with Addison's disease who must avoid all stress but whose handler would like to continue training in obedience.</p></p><p>Jean Donaldson heads the Academy for Dog Trainers out of the San Francisco SPCA. The Academy offers a full-time, six-week program in pet dog training and behavior counseling as well as one-week intensives and weekend seminars for existing trainers.

It is a magisterial work that took seventy people over six years to complete. The Journey to the West is at once a comedy, a drama, a satire, a meditation on faith and discipline, and a fantastical dramatization of China's history. Its creation covers many centuries and several dynasties. Begun during the Song Dynasty (10th~13th century), Journey is set against the backdrop of the 7th century Tang Dynasty, and tells the story of a priest named San Zang, who introduces China to the Mahayana Buddhist scriptures of India, and his trio of disciples: the monkey king Sun Wu Kong, the gluttonous pig Zhu Bajie, and the quiet but noble sea monster Sha Wu Jing. The San Zang who appears in Journey to the West is a specialist in Tripitaka, and is based on a real priest, named Xuan Zang. Xuan Zang lived from 602 to 664, and have traveled the western lands and traded with other countries along the western border from 627 or 629 to 645. More than three hundred years later, a story based on Xuan Zang's adventures, first appeared. The Journey to the West originated from this story. The Song Dynasty was founded in 960, yet because the only known author of Journey to the West, Wu Cheng en, died in 1582, during the Ming Dynasty, the story is considered the result of collective creation spanning five hundred years. The story also traveled through several countries and includes at least four different timelines. The events of Journey to the West, which include epic battles and threatened palaces and imperiled kings, could resonate with readers during almost any age, but the story focuses on portraying a peaceful society where deviance is ultimately trumped by enlightenment, violence defeated by benevolence. It is this balance, between depicting familiar events of conquest and telling a story about the search for truth, that makes The Journey to the West so beloved today. The author, Mr. Wei Dong Chen, is a highly acclaimed and beloved Chinese artist and an influential leader in the New Chinese Cartoon trend. His company, Creator World in Tianjin, is the largest comics studio in China. He has published hundreds of cartoons, which have been recognized for their strong literary value throughout the world. In 2005, he undertook the monumental effort of translating four classic Chinese novels into serialized comic form. After six years of great and enthusiastic work, he completed his dream, which now consists of 12,800 pages of beautiful drawings and epic storytelling. Monkey King is one of the four novels. Monkey King is a new landmark of comic artistry in China, and is a bold and exhilarating treatment of one of the definitive works of Chinese literature. <br><br> Vol. 3 Journey to the West <br> Sun Wu Kong, punished by Buddha centuries before, has spent five hundred years buried under Five-Finger Mountain when he encounters San Zang, a priest headed west in search of Buddhist scriptures. On the Goddess of Mercy s instructions, Wu Kong frees himself and assists the priest on a journey to the west that will be fraught with peril. But San Zang soon learns that trouble won t come only in the form of dragons or bandits; it will come from the violent and impetuous monkey who is now his companion.</p><p>Wei Dong Chen, a highly acclaimed and beloved artist, and an influential leader in the New Chinese Cartoon trend, is the founder of Creator World in Tianjin, the largest comics studio in China. Recently the Chinese government entrusted him with the role of general manager of the Beijing Book Fair, and his reputation as a pillar of Chinese comics has brought him many students. He has published more than four hundred cartoons, which have been recognized for their strong literary value not only in Korea, but in Europe and Japan, as well. Free spirited and energetic, Wei Dong Chen s positivist philosophy is reflected in the wisdom of his work. He is published serially in numerous publications while continuing to conceive projects that explore new dimensions of the form.</p><h2>Dead Man Walking: An Eyewitness Account of the Death Penalty in the United States</h2><p>In 1982, Sister Helen Prejean became the spiritual advisor to Patrick Sonnier, the convicted killer of two teenagers who was sentenced to die in the electric chair of Louisiana's Angola State Prison. In the months before Sonnier's death, the Roman Catholic nun came to know a man who was as terrified as he had once been terrifying. At the same time, she came to know the families of the victims and the men whose job it was to execute him--men who often harbored doubts about the rightness of what they were doing.<br><br>Out of that dreadful intimacy comes a profoundly moving spiritual journey through our system of capital punishment. Confronting both the plight of the condemned and the rage of the bereaved, the needs of a crime-ridden society and the Christian imperative of love, <b>Dead Man Walking</b> is an unprecedented look at the human consequences of the death penalty, a book that is both enlightening and devastating.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>"Destined to become the most influential anti-capital punishment statement since Albert Camus wrote' Reflections on the Guillotine ' in 1957...This unblinking book about the deliberate killing of human beings refuses to turn a blind eye to the sins of the murderers--be they prisoners or prison officials. The author, Sister Helen Prejean, is a Roman Catholic nun who has lived and worked with poor black families in New Orleans. Walking explores her personal and spiritual evolution into both a death penalty opponent and victims advocate, an evolution that begins when she serves as the spiritual advisor to two condemned men." --Washington Post Book World<br><br>"This arresting account should do for the debate over capital punishment what the film footage from Selma and Birmingham accomplished for the civil rights movement: turn abstractions into flesh and blood. Tough, fair, bravely alive--you will not come away from this book unshaken."--Bill McKibbenWhen Helen Prejean is invited to write to a prisoner on Death Row who brutally killed two teenagers, she has little idea how much it will change her life. Although she abhors his crime, she befriends one man as he faces the electric chair. Dead Man Walking is Helen Prejean&#39;s gripping true story, which formed the basis for a major motion picture event. As powerful an indictment of the death penalty as has ever been written, her book was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.</p><h2>Fire Cat</h2><p>Pickles is a mixed-up cat until the day Joe the fireman comes along and offers Pickles a home at his firehouse.</p><p></p><h2>Complete Self Help for Your Nerves</h2><p>During her long and illustrious career Dr Claire Weekes provided information, self-help techniques and comfort, both in person and through her lectures, writings and tapes, for many thousands of patients worldwide. <br><br> Although Claire Weekes is no longer alive, her empathic guidance lives on in this new volume compiled from the practical and supportive advice in her two popular books, <i>Self-Help for Your Nerves</i> and <i>More Help for Your Nerves.</i> Well over 300,000 copies of her most popular <i>Self-Help for Your Nerves</i> have been sold.

We think of mindfulness and meditation, immersion in a state of being where meaning is found through simplicity. Zen lore has been absorbed by Western practitioners and pop culture alike, yet there is a specific area of this ancient tradition that hasn&#x2019;t been fully explored in the West. Now, in <i>The</i> <i>Zen of Creativity,</i> American Zen master John Daido Loori presents a book that taps the principles of the Zen arts and aesthetic as a means to unlock creativity and find freedom in the various dimensions of our existence. Loori dissolves the barriers between art and spirituality, opening up the possibility of meeting life with spontaneity, grace, and peace.<br><br>Zen Buddhism is steeped in the arts. In spiritual ways, calligraphy, poetry, painting, the tea ceremony, and flower arranging can point us toward our essential, boundless nature. Brilliantly interpreting the teachings of the artless arts, Loori illuminates various elements that awaken our creativity, among them <i>still point</i>, the center of each moment that focuses on the tranquility within; <i>simplicity</i>, in which the creative process is uncluttered and unlimited, like a cloudless sky; <i>spontaneity</i>, a way to navigate through life without preconceptions, with a freshness in which everything becomes new;<i> mystery, </i>a sense of trust in the unknown;<i> creative feedback,</i> the systematic use of an audience to receive noncritical input about our art;<i> art koans,</i> exercises based on paradoxical questions that can be resolved only through artistic expression. Loori shows how these elements interpenetrate and function not only in art, but in all our endeavors.<br><br>Beautifully illustrated and punctuated with poems and reflections from Loori&#x2019;s own spiritual journey, <i>The</i> <i>Zen of Creativity</i> presents a multilayered, bottomless source of insight into our creativity. Appealing equally to spiritual seekers, artists, and veteran Buddhist practitioners, this book is perfect for those wishing to discover new means of self-awareness and expression&#x2014;and to restore equanimity and freedom amid the vicissitudes of our lives.</p><p><b>JOHN DAIDO LOORI</b> is the founder and abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery in Mount Tremper, New York. He grew up in a working-class New Jersey family, joined the navy, and later became a scientist and professional photographer before shaving his head, donning monk&#x2019;s robes, and embarking on the path of Zen. The monastery he founded in 1980 is one of the preeminent Zen training centers in the West, widely noted for its unique way of integrating art and Zen practice. Loori is the author of fourteen books on Zen. He has been interviewed and profiled by NBC, CBS, CNN, <i>Time</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, and <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> about the growing role of Buddhism in the United States. His photography has been exhibited in more than thirty one-person shows and has been published in leading photography magazines.Chapter 1<br><br>Melting Snow<br><br>All the way to heaven<br><br>is heaven itself.<br><br>In the fall of 1980, after I completed Zen training in Los Angeles with my teacher, Maezumi Roshi, I came to the East Coast with the intention of establishing a Zen arts center-a place where Zen training would be used as the vehicle for studying, enhancing, and cultivating a creative life.<br><br>The Zen Arts Center opened in Mount Tremper in October of 1980. Its main thrust was the practice of art within a Zen context.<br><br>Art had been a passion of mine since I was young, but its deep connection to my spiritual journey didn't become obvious until much later. I started photographing when I was ten, and by the time I'd reached my mid thirties photography had become an important part of my life. While working as a research scientist, I began teaching photography part-time at a local college. Spirituality was not in the picture-at least not overtly. The first time these two areas overlapped was in the late 1960s when I traveled to Boston from New York to see a photography exhibit titled "The Sound of One Hand," by Minor White.<br><br>I didn't yet have any sense that art might be a doorway to serious and transformative spiritual practice, but something more than good technique drew me to Minor's work. Minor was a "straight photographer": he didn't manipulate his prints during the developing process, yet his images transcended their subject. Looking at his photographs, I felt myself being pulled into another realm of consciousness. Minor's work pointed to a dynamic way of seeing, a new way of perceiving.<br><br>My life has been the poem I would have writ,<br><br>But I could not both live and utter it.<br><br>henry david thoreau<br><br>One day in 1971 I received a letter from Aperture magazine announcing a workshop that Minor was giving at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. I took one look at the price and threw the letter in the garbage. A friend saw me, and she picked it up.<br><br>"Isn't this the man you're always talking about?" she asked. I nodded. "Then why are you throwing the letter away?"<br><br>"I don't have the money to pay for it."<br><br>"Send it in, John," she said. "Something will come up."<br><br>And, miraculously, something did. A month later a tax refund that I had completely forgotten about arrived in the mail. I sent in my portfolio, along with my date and place of birth so an astrologer could determine whether this was an auspicious time for me to do the retreat. With the acceptance letter I got the workshop's reading list. It consisted of three books: Carlos Castaneda's A Separate Reality, Eugen Herrigel's Zen and the Art of Archery, and Richard Boleslavsky's Acting: The First Six Lessons. Nothing on photography. What did my astrological chart or these books have to do with photography? At the time I was making my living as a physical chemist, and my rational, highly critical mind did not take well to these requests. But I really wanted to study with Minor, so I went along with what he asked.<br><br>When I arrived at the Hotchkiss School I saw that there were sixty participants, ranging in age from eighteen to seventy. Minor greeted us as we arrived. He was a striking figure, well over six feet tall, with a flowing mane of white hair. He moved quietly, gracefully, and when he entered a space, he filled it completely.<br><br>This oceanic feeling of wonder is the<br><br>common source of religious mysticism, of<br><br>pure science and art for art's sake.<br><br>arthur koestler<br><br>The first full day of the workshop began at four in the morning. The sound of a bass drum moving down the hallway arrived without warning. It was pitch black outside. How are we going to photograph in the dark? I wondered. Drowsily, I dressed and filed outside with the others. We gathered on a grassy field and a modern dancer began to lead us through a series of exercises. Everyone was participating, including Minor.<br><br>I turned to the man next to me. "Why are we doing this? What does this have to do with photography?"<br><br>"Ssshhhhh. Just do it," he said.<br><br>I had paid hundreds of dollars to study photography with Minor, and I wasn't about to spend the week undulating in the dark! Furious, I stormed away.<br><br>Back in my room, I started to pack my things. Dawn was breaking, and the line of dancers caught my eye as I passed the window. They were spread across the length of the field. I took the camera, screwed on a telephoto lens, and began to shoot, feeling very pleased with myself. They can do whatever they want. I'm going to photograph. That thought perfectly summarized where I was at that time in my life: standing apart, looking at the world through a lens, like a voyeur.<br><br>After the morning session, a group of students led by the dance instructor came to my room to convince me to stay. "You're not giving it a chance," they said. "You're copping out." I could have defended myself, but I was moved by the fact that they even cared whether I stayed or left. And deep down I knew that I couldn't just walk away. I wanted so badly to learn to see the way Minor did, to photograph my subjects in a way that didn't render them lifeless and two-dimensional.<br><br>As the days unfolded I woke up before dawn, meditated, and danced with everyone else. We attended lectures and did various exercises. We didn't even touch our cameras for the first day or two. Then Minor began to challenge us with different questions that dealt with our way of seeing ourselves and the universe, questions that needed to be resolved visually.<br><br>One of these assignments was a turning point for me. On day four of the workshop, Minor told us to photograph our essence. "Don't photograph your personality," he explained. "Try to go deep into the core of your being. Photograph who you really are."<br><br>Who I really am? I was absorbed in this question as I walked outside and sat in the field underneath a sprawling oak. I suddenly started sobbing. I couldn't stop, and I had no idea why. Somehow, that seemed terribly funny, and I began to laugh. I kept laughing until I was exhausted. Who am I? That question repeated itself over and over in my mind.<br><br>Back in my room, I packed my 4 � 5 camera and a small backpack, prepared to stay out overnight in order to resolve this question. I set off for the nearby forest and began wandering. Minor's instructions echoed in my mind: Venture into the landscape without expectations. Let your subject find you. When you approach it, you will feel resonance, a sense of recognition. If, when you move away, the resonance fades, or if it gets stronger as you approach, you'll know you have found your subject. Sit with your subject and wait for your presence to be acknowledged. Don't try to make a photograph, but let your intuition indicate the right moment to release the shutter. If, after you've made an exposure, you feel a sense of completion, bow and let go of the subject and your connection to it. Otherwise, continue photographing until you feel the process is complete.<br><br>The state of mind of the photographer while<br><br>creating is a blank. . . . [but] It is a very active state of mind really, a very receptive state of mind, ready<br><br>at an instant to grasp an image, yet with no image pre-formed in it at any time.<br><br>minor white<br><br>Minor's language was foreign to me. I had no idea what this resonance was supposed to feel like, or how I would recognize when my subject acknowledged me. I didn't know if I could feel a sense of completion, or what I was supposed to do to "let go." Yet, surprisingly, I was willing to trust Minor, and the process. Somehow, I intuited that I could do what he had asked. More importantly, I knew that I had to do it in order to answer the question.<br><br>Around noon I came to a beautiful gully and decided to rest. I built a small fire, leaned against a rock, and was eating my lunch when I sensed someone's presence nearby. I looked up and saw the elegant figure of a man standing at the top of the ridge, the sun glowing behind him. He climbed down the rocks toward me, and I recognized John, a modern dancer and one of Minor's senior students. I had been impressed with John since the beginning of the retreat. He would often photograph as he danced, leaping and turning in the air with a Polaroid camera in his hand. Like Minor's work, John's photos made me realize that there were other ways to<br><br>photograph, other ways to see that were not so rational or linear.<br><br>I invited John to join me and offered him a cup of tea. As soon as he sat down, I started jabbering about anything and everything. In the middle of my rant he abruptly whispered, "Listen! Listen!" In the silence I heard a faint tinkling. Intrigued, I picked up my camera and headed off toward the sound, leaving John behind. I soon found myself in thick, dark woods. A brook trickled through the mossy rocks. Light streamed through the trees; bright reflections danced on the water in the surrounding darkness. Enchanted by the scene, I stayed by the brook for an hour or more, completing several photographs in a slow, methodical, almost meditative way.<br><br>When I returned to the gully John was gone, and there was no sign of him ever having been there. The cup of tea I had offered him was still in my knapsack, completely clean. There were no crumbs on the ground, no traces of him anywhere. It was as if our meeting had never happened-in fact, I wasn't sure that it had.<br><br>I packed up and continued my wandering. As the sun passed the zenith and began its descent across the sky, the light that filtered through the canopy of trees became softer and warmer. None of the photographs I had taken so far seemed to touch the essence toward which Minor had pointed me.<br><br>Again, I heard Minor's voice in my head. Photograph who you really are. I was looking at the ground, navigating over big roots with the heavy camera on my shoulder. I looked up and saw a tree standing a few feet aw...</p><h2>Pawn to Queen Four: A Novel</h2><p>In a comic novel of drag courts, an influential radio preacher, Brother Earl, threatens to incite a homosexual witch hunt, despite the existence of some compromising photographs</p><p>In 1993, Eighner's Travels with Lizbeth garnered numerous critical bouquets, praise that seems likely to be encored for this outre outing. That memoir of the author's years as a homeless struggling writer scrutinized the underbelly of Austin, Tex. The larky escapades chronicled here are set chiefly in a fanciful gay community that is labeled Austin but could as easily be Barrie's Neverland. Indeed, Eighner's wit is sprinkled about the proceedings like so much fairy dust. His repartee is scintillating (when it isn't puzzling, and sometimes it's both), and he knows precisely when and how to spring the unexpected non sequitur or the dead-on satiric barb. The story begins in the Imperial Court of the Jade Chimera, an Austin institution presided over by Madam Agnes (ne Angus McKinney), a 60-ish drag queen who makes RuPaul look like a dowdy has-been. Agnes dispatches the newly arrived hunk du jour, Jim, to Osage, Okla., where he is to recover certain incriminating photos from Brother Earl, a sleazy evangelist who heads the Holy Word of God University and Technical Institute. Subsequent episodes involve Osage's one gay bar (a hilarious watering hole worthy of its own novel), a Ku Klux Klan meeting gone awry and a plethora of quirky personalities. In a stylish display of plot and character juggling, however, Eighner eventually merges his rapid-fire scene and story line switcheroos into a dizzy, dazzling whole. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Eighner, author of the highly praised Travels with Lizbeth (LJ 11/15/93), takes the reader on an irreverent romp through gay society in Texas and Oklahoma. He pits Agnes, an aging, giant-sized queen, against Brother Earl, a fire-breathing fundamentalist minister who's about to go on an antihomosexual crusade. Using the naive Jim as her agent, Agnes aims to recover a lost series of compromising photographs that have held Brother Earl in check for years. In the end, Eighner's characters swish their way to victory in a most politically incorrect manner that is sure to stir readers to laughter. This book will not be to everyone's taste, though: Eighner's use of gay jargon has a way of excluding the uninitiated, and conservative readers will be put off by the subject matter. Nonetheless, this is a wickedly funny romp in which the outrageous triumphs over evil. Highly recommended for serious fiction collections.?Andrea Caron Kempf, Johnson Cty. Community Coll.

How shocking-and intriguing-to discover her host is an infamous ladies&#39; man known for his indecent (and, ah, inspiring) poetry! They call him The Libertine, and his poetry is just as scandalous-and irresistible-as he is. But after one duel too many forces Rhys Gillray, Earl of Rawden, from lively London to his country estate, he&#39;s in desperate need of a cure for boredom. And the proper but beautiful vicar&#39;s daughter seems like the perfect test of his sensual skills. With wit and wiliness, Rhys strips away Sabrina&#39;s defenses. But as he teaches her pleasure, the emotional stakes of their sensual duel go beyond anything Rhys has ever known. For deep in his past lies the missing clue to the crime that destroyed Sabrina&#39;s family. And all The Libertine&#39;s seductive secrets may not be enough to save their future and their hearts.</p><p>Sabrina Fairleigh, adopted daughter of the vicar of Tinbury, "counts herself fortunate to be possessed of an even temperament" and imagines it must be a terrible inconvenience, and quite uncomfortable, to be at the mercy of one's passions. Not surprisingly, these views change when she meets the Libertine, otherwise known as Rhys Gillray, earl of Rawden, in this amusing Regency romance. Rhys, author of a seductive poetry volume that has both scandalized and enthralled the women of the <i>ton</i>, has grown bored of debauchery and decides that de-thawing the chilly Sabrina is the perfect project to keep his mind occupied and his skills sharp.

Unbeknownst to Sabrina, the murdered man holds the key to reuniting her long-lost family. Though a bit wordy, Long's sharp leads keep this witty tale of love, passion, family and betrayal moving nicely. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their function was publicity; they were sent out as &#39;glossies&#39; - as 8 x 10s - to newspapers, to fan magazines, to the multitudes of fans themselves, in order to set in the minds of the audience (in accordance with the studio&#39;s strategy of the moment) the image of the Star. These portraits were the work of such photographers a George Hurrell (he dared to photograph the great faces of the screen without makeup and knew before anyone else how to achieve the &#39;glamour&#39; photograph; Norma Shearer demanded that he alone photograph her; Loretta Young adored him)...Robert Coburn...Ted Allan...Josef von Sternberg (he directed and controlled every Dietrich portrait sitting until 1935)...Eugene Robert Richee...Ernest Bachrach (he headed the photographic department at RKO from its inception in 1929 through 1950; Gloria Swanson said of him: &#39;There was no other photographer in the world)...Laszlo Willinger (one of the foremost European photographers)...and the only woman among them and a notable pioneer, Ruth Harriet Louise (she headed the first portrait gallery at MGM when she was only nineteen; &#39;Her photographs were magnificent,&#39; Lillian Gish said. &#39;I took orders from her as I would have from D.W.

After the discovery that one of the staff members had been selling Anetakis hotel plans to a competitor, Theron and his brothers had cleaned house, hiring new staff. The culprit, Chrysander's former personal assistant, was behind bars after a plea bargain. They had been leery of replacing her and allowing another employee unfettered access to sensitive company information, but in the end, Theron had opted to bring in his secretary from the London office. She was older, stable and most importantly, loyal. Though after the debacle with Roslyn, none of the Anetakis brothers were keen to trust another employee implicitly.<br><br>Theron's arrival from London had been met by a pile of documents, contracts, messages and e-mails. Two days later, he was still trying to make sense of the mess. And to think his secretary had already weeded out the majority of the clutter.<br><br>He paused over one letter addressed to Chrysander and almost tossed it as junk mail, but yanked it back into his line of vision when he saw what it said. His brow furrowed deeper as he scanned the page, and stretched out his other hand for the phone.<br><br>Uncaring of the time difference, or that he would probably wake Chrysander, he punched in the number and waited impatiently for the call to go through. He spared a brief moment of guilt that he would also be disturbing Marley, Chrysander's wife, but hopefully he would pick up the phone before it wakened her.<br><br>"This better be damn good," Chrysander growled in a sleepy voice.<br><br>Theron didn't waste time with pleasantries. "Who the hell is Isabella?" he demanded.<br><br>"Isabella?" There was no doubt as to the confusion in Chrysander's voice. "You're calling me at this hour to ask me about a woman?"<br><br>"Tell me..." Theron shook his head. No, Chrysander wouldn't be unfaithful to Marley. Whatever this woman was to Chrysander, it must have been before he met Marley. "Just tell me what I need to know in order to get rid of her," Theron said impatiently. "I've a letter here informing you of her progress, whatever the hell that means, and that she's graduated successfully." Theron's lips thinned in disgust. <em>"Theos,</em> Chrysander. Isn't she a bit young for you to have been involved with?"<br><br>Chrysander exploded in a torrent of Greek, and Theron held the phone from his ear until the storm calmed.<br><br>"I do not like your implication, little brother," Chrysander said in an icy voice. "I am married. Of course I am not involved with this Isabella." And then Theron heard Chrysander's sharp intake of breath. <em>"Bella.</em> Of course," he murmured. "I'm not thinking clearly at this hour of the night."<br><br>"And I repeat, who is this Bella?" Theron asked, his patience running out.<br><br>"Caplan. Isabella Caplan. Surely you remember, Theron."<br><br>"Little Isabella?" Theron asked in surprise. He hadn't remembered her at all until Chrysander mentioned her last name. An image of a gangly, preteen girl with po-nytails and braces shot to mind. He'd seen her a few times since, but he honestly couldn't conjure an image. He remembered her being shy and unassuming, always trying to fade into the background. She'd been at his parents' funeral, but he'd been too consumed with grief to pay attention to the young woman. How old would she have been then?<br><br>Chrysander chuckled. "She's not so little anymore. She will have just graduated. Was doing quite well. Intelligent girl."<br><br>"But why are you getting a report on her?" Theron asked. "For God's sake, I thought she might be a former mistress, and the last thing I wanted was her causing trouble for Marley."<br><br>"While your devotion to my wife is commendable, it's hardly necessary," Chrysander said dryly. Then he sighed. "Our obligation to Bella had temporarily slipped my mind. My focus of late has been on Marley and our child."<br><br>"What obligation?" Theron asked sharply. "And why haven't I heard of this before?"<br><br>"Our fathers were longtime friends and business partners. Her father extracted a promise from our father that if anything should ever happen to him that Isabella would be looked after. Our father preceded her father in death, so I assumed responsibility for her welfare when her father also passed away."<br><br>"Then you should know that, according to this letter, she's arriving in New York two days from now," Theron said.<br><br>Chrysander cursed. "I can't leave Marley right now."<br><br>"Of course you can't," Theron said impatiently. "I'll take care of it. But I need details. The last thing you need right now is to be saddled with another concern. New York is my responsibility. I'll count this as yet another problem I've inherited when we traded offices."<br><br>"Bella won't be any problem. She's a sweet girl. All you need to do is help her settle her affairs and make sure her needs are provided for. She doesn't gain full control of her inheritance until she's twenty-five or she marries, whichever happens first, so in the meantime Anetakis International acts as the trustee. As you are now the New York representative of Anetakis, that makes you her guardian of sorts."<br><br>Theron groaned. "I knew I should have bloody well made Piers take over the New York office."<br><br>Chrysander laughed. "This will be a piece of cake, little brother. It shouldn't take you long at all to make sure she's settled and has everything she needs."<br><br>* * *<br><br>Isabella Caplan had no sooner made it past the airport security checkpoint when she saw a man in a chauffeur's uniform holding a sign with her name on it.<br><br>She held up a hand in a wave and made her way over. To her surprise, two other men stepped forward to flank her. Her confusion must have showed because the chauffeur smiled and said, "Welcome to New York, Ms. Caplan. I'm Henry, your driver for today, and these gentlemen are from Mr. Anetakis's security detail."<br><br>"Uh, hi," she said.<br><br>"I've arranged for someone to collect your luggage from baggage claim," Henry said as he herded her toward the exit. "It will be delivered to the hotel shortly."<br><br>Outside, one of the security men held the limousine door open for her then got in after her, while the second climbed into the front seat with Henry. Privacy wasn't in the cards, and what she really wanted to do was wilt all over her seat.<br><br>Isabella leaned back as the limousine pulled away from the passenger pickup area en route to Imperial Park, the hotel owned by the Anetakis brothers. Chry-sander had arranged a suite anytime she visited New York, not that it had occurred often.<br><br>This trip had been planned as nothing more than a brief stopover on her way to Europe, a fact she'd apprised Chrysander of in her correspondence. All of that had changed the minute she'd received a terse missive from Theron Anetakis informing her that he was now overseeing her affairs, and he would meet briefly with her in New York to make sure she had everything she needed for her trip abroad.<br><br>He didn't know it yet, but her trip was a thing of the past. She was going to stay in New York...indefinitely.<br><br>The limousine pulled up in front of the hotel and ground smoothly to a halt. Her door opened, and the security guard who'd ridden in front extended his hand to assist her out. Once inside the lobby, she was ushered immediately to her suite, bypassing the front desk altogether.<br><br>Within ten minutes, her luggage was delivered to her room along with a bouquet of flowers and a basket filled with an assortment of snacks and fruits.<br><br>If that wasn't enough, just as she settled onto the couch to kick off her shoes and catch her breath, another knock sounded. Grumbling under her breath, she went to open the door and found another hotel employee standing there. He extended a smooth, cream-colored envelope.<br><br>"A message from Mr. Anetakis."<br><br>She raised an eyebrow. "Which Mr. Anetakis?"<br><br>The young man looked discomfited. "Theron."<br><br>She smiled, thanked him and then closed the door. She turned the envelope over and lightly ran her finger over the inscription on the front. Isabella Caplan. Had he written it himself?<br><br>Experiencing a moment of silliness, she brought the paper to her nose, hoping to catch his smell. There. Light but undeniably his scent. She remembered it as though it were yesterday. He obviously still wore the same cologne.<br><br>She broke open the seal and pulled the card from the envelope. In a distinctly masculine scrawl, he'd written his instructions for her to come to his office the next morning.<br><br>An amused smile curved her lips. As arrogant as she remembered. Summoning her like a wayward child. At least Chrysander had dropped by her suite to check in on her. But then she'd been a mere eighteen, and he'd also provided a veritable nanny to chaperone her for her visit to the city.<br><br>She'd be more than happy to meet Theron on his terms. It would make it that more satisfying to rock him back on his heels. The basis for her big trip to Europe had been solely because that was where Theron lived. Or had lived. When Chrysander married, he and his wife moved to his Greek island on a permanent basis. Which meant that Theron had moved a lot closer to Isabella. Finally.<br><br>The trip to Europe was off. Her seduction of Theron was on.<br><br>She sank onto the couch and put her feet up on the coffee table. Vibrant red toenail polish flashed in front of her as she wiggled her toes. The delicate ankle bracelet flashed and shimmered with the movement of her foot.<br><br>Theron had only gotten more gorgeous over the last few years. He'd lost the youthful handsomeness and replaced it with raw masculinity. While she'd been waiting to grow up so she could stake her claim, he'd only become more desirable. More irresistible. And she'd only fallen more in love with him.<br><br>It wouldn't be easy. She didn't imagine he'd fall readily into her arms. The Anetakis brothers were hard. They could have any woman they wanted. They were ruthless in business, but they were also loyal, and honor was everything.<br><br>The phone rang, and she sighed in aggravation. The phone was across the room, and she was quite comfortable on the couch. Shoving herself up, she stumbled over to answer it.<br><br>"Hello?"<br><br>There was a brief silence. "Ms. Caplan&#x2014;Isabella."<br><br>She recognized the accented English, and a thrill skirted down her spine. It wasn't Chrysander, and given that Piers was out of the country and had never so much as had a conversation with Isabella, it could only be Theron.<br><br>"Yes," she said huskily, hoping her nervousness wasn't betrayed.<br><br>"This is Theron Anetakis. I was calling to make sure you made it in okay and are settling in with no difficulty."<br><br>"Thank you. Everything is fine."<br><br>"Is the suite to your liking?"<br><br>"Yes, of course. It was kind of you to reserve it for me."<br><br>"I didn't reserve it," he said impatiently. "It's my private suite."<br><br>She looked around with renewed interest. Knowing that she was staying where Theron spent a lot of his time gave her a decadent thrill.<br><br>"Then where are you staying?" she asked curiously. "Why would you give up your suite?"<br><br>"The hotel is undergoing renovations. The only available suite was...mine. I'm temporarily taking a different room."<br><br>She laughed. "I could have taken other accommodations. There was no need for you to move out for me."<br><br>"A few days won't make a difference," he said. "You should be comfortable before your trip to Europe."<br><br>She swallowed back the denial that she would be going to Europe. No sense in putting him on guard as soon as she arrived. There'd be plenty of time to apprise him of her change in plans. Mainly when he had no chance of talking her out of it.<br><br>A mischievous smile curved her lips. "I received your summons."<br><br>He made a sound of startled exclamation that sounded suspiciously like an oath. "Surely I didn't sound so autocratic, Ms. Caplan."<br><br>"Please, call me Isabella. Or Bella. Surely you remember when we weren't so formal? Granted it's been a few years, but I haven't forgotten a single thing about you."<br><br>There was an uncomfortable silence. And then, "All right, Isabella."<br><br>"Bella, please."<br><br>"All right.Bella," he conceded.<br><br>He made an exasperated sound in her ear and then said, "Now what was it we were discussing again?"<br><br>He sounded distracted, and though he was unfailingly polite, she knew he wanted rid of her as soon as possible. She grinned. If he only knew...<br><br>"We were discussing your autocratic demand for me to appear at your office tomorrow."<br><br>"It was a request, Bella," he said patiently.<br><br>"And of course I will honor it. Shall we say ten in the morning then? I'm a bit tired, and I'd like to sleep in."<br><br>"Of course. Don't overtax yourself. Order in room service tonight for dinner. Your expenses are being taken care of."<br><br>Of course. She hadn't expected anything less and knew better than to argue. The Anetakis brothers were thorough if nothing else. And very serious about their perceived obligations.<br><br>"I'll see you tomorrow then," she said.<br><br>He uttered an appropriate goodbye, and she hung up the phone. A smile popped her lips upward as she hugged her midsection in delight. Oh, she'd planned to pay him a visit the next day, all right.<br><br></p><h2>A Second Is A Hiccup</h2><p>"How long is a second?"<br><br>"A second is a hiccup--the time it takes to kiss your mom, or jump a rope, or turn around."<br>The newest book by acclaimed picture-book creators Hazel Hutchins and Kady McDonald Denton explains units of time in imaginative terms children can understand: A second lasts as long as a hiccup; a week is seven sleeps; and a year is the time it takes to grown into new shoes!<br>Any parent who's been asked, "How long is a minute?" or any kid who's wondered, "What does 'an hour' mean?" will enjoy this smart, simple, and surprising book.</p><p>After many years of juggling writing, raising her children, and making a home with her now deceased husband, Hazel spends her days writing full time. Winner of Writer&#x2019;s Guild of Alberta Award for Children&#x2019;s Literature, she has written children&#x2019;s short fiction for Chirp, Chickadee, and Cricket.<br>When answering where the inspiration for A Second is a Hiccup came from, Hazel comments, &#x201c;I decided to see if I could find other ways to describe time. When the writing began to flow in poetic form &#x2015; and when I came up with the engaging title line A Second is a Hiccup &#x2015; I knew I had begun a labor of love. The book went through many incarnations....in one version I actually brought in centuries and eons! Good grief! But it finally returned to exactly what it should be...immediate, simple and close-to-home. It is my sincere hope that children of all types will enjoy finding and celebrating, among the pages, the many ways they spend their time.&#x201d;<br>Kady MacDonald Denton has illustrated more than forty picture books, including the New York Times bestseller A VISITOR FOR BEAR by Bonny Becker, and A SECOND IS A HICCUP by Hazel Hutchins. She lives in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. Please visit her website at www.kadymacdonalddenton.ca.*Starred Review* Hutchins explains the lengths of various time units in original, child-centered terms. A second is how long it takes to hiccup or "to kiss your mom / Or jump a rope / Or turn around." A minute is not just 60 seconds, it's also time enough for 60 hiccups, 60 hops, or a little song including the chorus and the verses. And so on, through an hour, a day, a week, a month, and a year. Ingenious examples include a month as the time it takes for a scraped shin to grow new skin and a year as how long it takes to outgrow a pair of shoes. Often falling into rhymed couplets, the fluid text reads aloud well. Few contemporary illustrators depict children with such understanding, grace, and quirky charm as Denton, whose previous picture books include Claire Masurel's <i>Two Homes </i>(2001) and Nan Gregory's <i>Amber Waiting </i>(2002). Here the diverse cast of characters centers on three children who interact with one another, their parents, and their siblings as they participate in a year's worth of activities. Washed with gentle colors, the sensitive drawings portray children who are secure, actively engaged, and sometimes joyful within their community of family and friends. The first American edition of a Canadian title, this picture book is a worthy companion to Charlotte Zolotow's equally child-centered classic <i>Over and Over</i> (1957) as well as a fresh take on the passage of time. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

True to Pentecostal theology, the Jimmy Swaggart Commentary collection leads it sreaders chapter by chapter to a better understanding of the Bible. Rather than providing notes on every Bibleverse, these commentaries focus on the salient verses of each chapter to offer the reader a condensed synopsis of what the Holy Spirit intended. Where most relevant, cultural and historical references are also included, along with explanations of the allegories, types, and symbolisms used in the Bible to ad depth and dimension for students of the Holy Scriptures. Yet, what seems to separate this work from all other commentaries are the biblical applications made to present day circumstances facing every believer.

From this starting point, the acclaimed Italian philosopher Paolo Virno examines the construct of memory, the passage of time, and the &#x201c;end of history.&#x201d; Through thinkers such as Bergson, Koj�ve and Nietzsche, Virno shows how our perception of history can become suspended or paralysed, making the distinction between &#x201c;before&#x201d; and &#x201c;after,&#x201d; cause and effect, seem derisory. In examining the way the experience of time becomes historical, Virno forms a radical new theory of historical temporality.</p><p><b>Paolo Virno</b> teaches Philosophy at the University of Rome.

Hairy Harry's Fish Shop is his intended destination?but not, alas, his destiny. When a woman on the subway hands him a piece of paper?a personal invitation to the Magic Lantern Restaurant?Max, opener of doors, attends. And so, Max meets Vivek ("your genial genie, your garrulous guru, your suave swami"). With him, Max soars toward India on a small carpet and from his new transcendent vantage point looks down with awe at the array of life in the streets below. And readers see it too, in warm rich earth tones and generous strokes of bright color, a double-page painting inviting readers into "I-Spy," as Kalman's text rolls out a litany of descriptions to match the images. Each subsequent page offers a new turn down Max's path to enlightenment?through bits of wordplay and allusion, geography and history, philosophy and poetry, fun and games; through vivid paintings small as postage stamps, framed pictures formal and arresting, images expansive and fanciful. This guided tour is inventive and personal, but, best of all, beyond Max's madcap meanderings there emerges a sense of humor that comes from a knowledge and appreciation of Indian culture. Is this a book for children or an adult picture book? Of course art finds its own audience and those who appreciate Kalman's talents may bring a range of responses to a reading?sophistication, insight, life experience, or a child's simple openness to the surprising way words and images and ideas create mysterious and amusing worlds upon a page. True, this is a book beyond children, in a sense, but it is also one that speaks to all who "enter in."

As she recovers, Kit has horrible dreams of a red room. Months later, Doll is arrested for murder. As Doll&#39;s obsession with Kit escalates, Kit is gripped with a paralyzing fear that the killer isn&#39;t Doll--but someone close to her heart.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, August 2001:</b> Already a sensation in England, Nicci French (the pseudonym of a London couple who've turned their marriage into a writing partnership as well) is quickly gaining recognition and fans on this side of the Atlantic, too. French's two previous novels published here, <i>Killing Me Softly</i> and <i>Beneath the Skin</i>, are romantic thrillers with hard edges--a little like a marriage of convenience between Sally Beauman and Ian Rankin.<p> But <i>The Red Room</i> is a change of pace that is reminiscent of Frances Fyfield, only without her stylistic quirks. It also asks a lot of the reader in imagining the deliberately obtuse or arrogant ways in which the police sometimes interfere in the lives of those not on the public payroll.</p><p> In this case, the two people whose lives are being most unfairly manipulated hold opposite, even antagonistic, places in society. One is a clinical psychologist, Katherine Quinn; the other, Michael Doll, is the troubled young man who not long ago left her with terrible facial disfigurement, having suddenly attacked her while undergoing an evaluation in his jail cell. Somehow, out of curiosity, misplaced duty, and a desire to try to "reduce him to his human size," Kit Quinn allows a police detective to talk her into seeing Michael once again. This time her nemesis--about whom she has recurring nightmares of a blood-spattered red room--stands accused of murder. The trouble is, after coming face to face with him, Dr. Quinn isn't at all convinced he's guilty.</p><p> Nicci French has better success with the setup of this suspenseful, twisty situation than she does with its resolution. But <i>The Red Room</i> provides superior entertainment, with a complex and all-too-human heroine at the center of its drama. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Nicci French lives in Northern England.</p><h2>The Lincoln Letter: A Peter Fallon Novel (Peter Fallon and Evangeline Carrington, 5)</h2><p><p>Treasure hunters Peter Fallon and Evangeline Carrington are heading for adventure in Washington D.C., the sleek, modern, power-hungry capital of America...and the crowded, muddy, intrigue-filled nexus of the Civil War.

If he was euphoric, and those who observed him that day attested later that he was, euphoria did not express itself either.</p><p>The letter lacked the poetry of his best speeches and demonstrated none of the cold and relentless logic of his political writing.</p><p>It was as simple, direct, and as blunt as a cannonball:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dear Lieutenant Hutchinson,</p><p>It comes to my attention that you are still alive. This means that you may still be in possession of something that I believe fell into your hands in the telegraph office three years ago. It would be best if you returned it, considering its potential to alter opinions regarding the difficulties just ended and those that lie ahead. If you do, a presidential pardon will be considered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A. Lincoln.</p><p>&nbsp;Lincoln did not inform his secretary about the letter.</p><p>It was unlikely that he wanted questions regarding correspondence with an officer who had served not only in the field but also in the War Department telegraph office, before coming into significant personal difficulty.</p><p>It would also have appeared strange that Lincoln did not address the letter to Lieutenant Hutchinson. He sent it instead to Private Jeremiah Murphy at the Armory Square Hospital on Seventh Street.</p><p>But even a president had his secrets.</p><p>Lincoln sealed the letter and slipped it into a pile of outgoing correspondence, some to be mailed, some to be hand delivered around the city.</p><p>It was just after eight when his wife appeared in the doorway to his office, where he was finishing a chat with a congressman. She was wearing a white dress with black stripes and a bonnet adorned with pink silk flowers. She had always favored flowers. But she had worn them less and less in the last four years. No woman who had lost a son and two half brothers, no woman who had watched her husband grow old under history&#x2019;s heaviest burden, would be inclined to wear anything but black.&nbsp; Still, flowers and dress did nothing to soften her voice. &#x201c;Mr. Lincoln, would you have us be late?&#x201d;</p><p>He said, &#x201c;To night, we shall laugh.&#x201d;</p><p>Then he called for his carriage, and they went to the theater.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><b></b>&nbsp;<b>ONE</b><br><b><i>Friday Night</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Peter Fallon received a copy of that letter as an attachment to an e-mail on the third Friday night of September.<br>He would not have read it, except that it came from Diana Wilmington, an assistant professor at the George Washington University and author of a controversial new book, <i>The Racism and Resolve of Abraham Lincoln.</i> The book had gotten her onto television, radio, magazine covers, and made her one of the most recognizable African American scholars in the country. Peter had also dated her when she was an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking of you,&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;I still read the Boston gossip pages.

Peter couldn&#x2019;t remember which of them first said, &#x201c;If it works don&#x2019;t fix it.&#x201d; But now, Evangeline was prepping a new project in New York, and Peter was guest-curating a new exhibit in Boston.<br>&#x201c;However,&#x201d; Diana went on, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not writing about your love life. I&#x2019;d like you to take a look at this attachment.&#x201d;<br>Peter clicked to the scanned image of a letter. He glanced first at the header, printed in an Old English typeface: &#x201c;Executive Mansion.&#x201d; Beneath it was the word &#x201c;Washington,&#x201d; the date April 14, 1865, and to the side, the word &#x201c;Private&#x201d; handwritten and circled. Then Peter&#x2019;s eye dropped to the signature, to the clear and characteristic cursive that was the Holy Grail of autograph collectors everywhere: <i>A. Lincoln.</i><br>In an instant, he knew that whatever this was, it was worth seven figures: a Lincoln signature, on a Lincoln letter, written from the Lincoln White House.<br>Then he looked again at the date and felt a chill: <i>the day Lincoln was shot.</i><br>He wiped the sweat from his palms, as if he were touching the original instead of seeing it on a computer screen. He almost went looking for white cotton curatorial gloves.<br>Could this be Lincoln&#x2019;s last letter? A last insight into the most analyzed, adulated, biographied, beloved, and, in a few places, detested man in American history? And what did this anonymous lieutenant have that mattered so much at the end of the Civil War?<br>Peter clicked again on the e-mail:<br>I held this letter in my hands a week ago, along with the envelope addressed to a Corporal Jeremiah Murphy. A man was offering it for sale to the American Museum of Emancipation. I told him we were very small, hoping to consolidate with the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture when it opens in 2015, but that I would talk to our board. When I tried to contact him two days ago, he had gone incommunicado. I had been planning to ask you to appraise the letter. Would you be willing to put your skills to finding it, or at least uncovering the story behind it?<br>Peter lifted the wine bottle. One more tip into the glass would bring him to the bottom of the label. When he drank alone&#x2014;something he&#x2019;d been doing more since the wedding that wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;he had a rule: Drink to the bottom of the label and no farther. Stopper the bottle. And every few nights, finish the high-quality dregs. So he poured a bit more, swirled, and sipped.<br>Then he wrote back:<br>The last big Lincoln letter to come on the market was his answer to the so-called Little People&#x2019;s Petition. It went for 3.2m in &#x2019;09. That&#x2019;s where the bidding starts on this, if it&#x2019;s authentic. So call me. I&#x2019;m up until midnight.<br>Then he drank the wine with a little wedge of �poisses: a big cab with a big cheese, an excellent nightcap. And NESN was nightcapping an excellent Red Sox game, which he missed because he had been working on a new exhibit for the Boston Public Library: &#x201c;A Northern City and the Civil War.&#x201d;<br>It was opening on September 22, the 150th anniversary of the day Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation.

After the body of a strangled and sexually violated male is found in a seedy hotel room, Thorne quickly learns that the victim was a convicted rapist. When a second recently released rapist is discovered in the same condition, Thorne believes he has a serial revenge killer on his hands. While some of his fellow policemen feel that the victims deserved their fate, Thorne's commitment to justice remains unfailing. Another murder follows, this time of a pornographer whom the detectives link to the other dead men. Billingham does not delve as deeply into either Thorne's personal issues or those of the other policemen as he did in his last book; the detective's dark brooding on the nature of death is replaced here by a healthier, less obsessive introspection.

He still has problems with women and commitment, and his father is still struggling with Alzheimer's, but Thorne has lightened up enough to get himself a girlfriend (though that doesn't work out quite the way he thought it would, to put it mildly). The structure is much like that of the other books, with the anonymous killer alternating chapters with Thorne and his partners until all of them come together in a shocking climax.

The works of Plato collected under the title <i>The Trial and Death of Socrates </i>have been particularly influential because they provide both an excellent point of entry into Plato&#x2019;s vast philosophy and a strikingly vivid portrait of Plato&#x2019;s mentor, Socrates &#x2013; one of the most uncompromising intellectuals in the pantheon of human history and culture. While arguments presented in some of Plato&#x2019;s other dialogues add essential dimensions to our understanding of his thought, it is possible to find the core elements of Plato&#x2019;s system in <i>Euthyphro</i>, <i>Apology</i>, <i>Crito</i>, and <i>Phaedo,</i> and it is predominantly through Plato&#x2019;s account in these works of the words and actions of Socrates during his trial and execution for impiety that the latter&#x2019;s nobility and profound integrity have become known to succeeding generations.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Plato was born to an aristocratic Athenian family in 427 BC, became an adherent of the already notorious arguer Socrates in his youth, and likely abandoned Athens for several years following Socrates&#x2019; execution in 399 BC. Back in Athens, he founded his infamous school, the Academy, on his estate of the same name, probably in the 360s. Though the curriculum of Plato&#x2019;s Academy changed significantly during the years after his death, the school itself remained an important center of learning until AD 529, when the Eastern Roman Emperor dissolved it during a purge of non-Christian institutions. There is no consensus on precisely when or why Plato began writing the incomparably thought-provoking collection of dialogues and letters that has come down to us. Some commentators suggest that his earliest writings were set down prior to Socrates&#x2019; execution as aids to the memory of those who witnessed or participated in the latter&#x2019;s arguments, while many others believe that it was Socrates&#x2019; death that stimulated Plato to begin documenting for posterity the intellectual achievements of his friend and teacher. In any event, Plato&#x2019;s sweeping and multifaceted philosophy, as documented in his voluminous writings, has never ceased to exert a remarkably pervasive influence upon the intellectual culture of the West. It decisively shaped the thought of St. Augustine (AD 354 - 386) and through him infiltrated virtually all subsequent Christian theology. Moreover, from ancient times until the present, there have been few great Western thinkers &#x2013; religious or secular &#x2013; who have failed to acknowledge an unparalleled debt to Plato.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>It is customary to divide Plato&#x2019;s dialogues into early, middle, and late periods. In the early writings it is believed that Plato was strongly under Socrates&#x2019; influence and, therefore, that the characterization of Socrates&#x2019; thought and method of discourse in these so-called &#x201c;Socratic dialogues&#x201d; accurately reflects Plato&#x2019;s recollections of his teacher. In Plato&#x2019;s middle period, Socrates is made the spokesman for a philosophy that notably differs from anything articulated in the early writings. Here it is suspected that Plato is setting forth his own philosophy &#x2013; one that grew out of reflection upon unresolved dilemmas raised by Socrates&#x2019; philosophical activity and by the traumatic experience of Socrates&#x2019; untimely demise. This middle-period philosophy can be viewed as Plato&#x2019;s effort to produce a defense of Socrates&#x2019; virtue and a metaphysical system explaining the structure of a reality in which a good and just man can be executed for publicly seeking the truth. In the late writings, the metaphysics of the middle period is subjected to withering criticism and, though not jettisoned, recognized as seriously problematic. Of the four dialogues in the present volume, <i>Euthyphro</i>, <i>Apology</i>, and <i>Crito</i> are all widely agreed to belong to the early period. <i>Phaedo, conversely,</i> is regarded as belonging to the middle period or as a transitional work marking the beginning of the middle period. This is of importance because it provides insight into what is taking place in <i>The Trial and Death of Socrates </i>in the subtext of Socrates approaching his trial for impiety and corrupting the youth (<i>Euthyphro</i>), giving an unsuccessful defense (<i>Apology</i>), rejecting an offer to escape Athens before his execution (<i>Crito</i>), and, on his final day, discussing the merits of belief in an afterlife and then drinking his poison (<i>Phaedo</i>).</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Socrates, the central figure in most of Plato&#x2019;s dialogues, left no written record of his ideas. The image we have of him is almost entirely the product of his depiction by Plato, though he also figures prominently in the dialogues of Xenophon and other contemporary authors and is caricatured in Aristophanes&#x2019; play <i>The Clouds</i>. And though, in the last analysis, it is Plato&#x2019;s &#x201c;Socrates&#x201d; who has influenced mankind through the ages and with whom we are rightfully concerned, we should be aware that other sources give alternative accounts of Socrates&#x2019; character, beliefs, and actions, and that the historical veracity of Plato&#x2019;s depiction is doubtful.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The events of Socrates&#x2019; life, however, take place against a well-documented historical background, though this is largely left implicit in Plato&#x2019;s writings. What is most essential for the reader to know about this background is that Socrates&#x2019; native city-state, Athens, was once ancient Greece&#x2019;s flagship democracy. Despite the facts that the right of citizenship was granted only to a fraction of Athenian inhabitants and that during Socrates&#x2019; lifetime the Athenian democracy succumbed twice to the rule of tyrannical oligarchs, the onetime power and prosperity of democratic Athens signaled a major political innovation in the ancient world. Coinciding with the rise of democracy in Greece came an increasing prioritization of oratory skills. For in the agora, where citizens met to decide upon the affairs of state, the majority needed to be persuaded of appropriate courses of action. And so, in the century prior to Socrates&#x2019; execution, traveling teachers of a peculiar type of oratory began to appear. These teachers, famously known as &#x201c;Sophists,&#x201d; received payment for teaching prominent aristocratic youths techniques for winning arguments, regardless of the correctness of the arguer&#x2019;s position, and thus they were widely regarded as parasites and public nuisances. This is an important point in relationship to the narrative of <i>The Trial and Death of Socrates</i> because though Socrates was officially accused of impiety and corrupting Athenian youth with his blasphemous ideas, his defense in the <i>Apology</i> consists essentially of a denial that he was a Sophist &#x2013; something with which he was not explicitly charged.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>In <i>Euthyphro</i> we find Socrates, on the way to his trial, pausing to engage in his typical form of inquiry with a theologian named Euthyphro, who claims to know with certainty the nature of &#x201c;piety&#x201d; or &#x201c;holiness.&#x201d; Socrates&#x2019; method is to pose to Euthyphro the question, &#x201c;What is piety?&#x201d; and when Euthyphro offers an answer, to ask him probing questions about it until he retreats. Once again, Socrates asks, &#x201c;What is piety?&#x201d; A new answer is offered, and the cycle begins again. Ultimately this leads Euthyphro &#x2013; as it did many of Socrates interlocutors &#x2013; to give up and slip away. This portrayal of Socrates&#x2019; activity coincides with what Aristotle &#x2013; a student at the Academy during the last two decades of Plato&#x2019;s life &#x2013; has to say about it: &#x201c;Socrates was occupying himself with the excellences of character, and in connection with them became the first to raise the problem of universal definition. . .two things may be fairly ascribed to Socrates &#x2013; inductive arguments and universal definitions, both of which are concerned with the starting-point of [knowledge].&#x201d; The first observation to make here about the agreement between Aristotle&#x2019;s comments on Socrates and the latter&#x2019;s depiction in <i>Euthyphro</i> (and other early dialogues) is Socrates&#x2019; preoccupation with &#x201c;excellences of character,&#x201d; i.e., with morality. Thus the inquiry here is about piety, and in other early dialogues it is about virtues such as justice, courage, and temperance. The next point is that what Socrates seeks as a valid answer to his question &#x201c;What is piety?&#x201d; is a universal definition, not an example or even a whole collection of examples of piety. Socrates&#x2019; criteria for a valid definition are implicit in his objections to Euthyphro&#x2019;s answers: It must be the characteristic which is the same in all instances of the thing inquired about; it must be the distinguishing characteristic marking those things off from other things; it must be the &#x201c;essence&#x201d; of those things &#x2013; i.e., that which makes them be what they are &#x2013; and as such, a standard by which one could measure whether or not something was an example of this kind of thing. Lastly, Aristotle credits Socrates with inventing inductive argument in the course of his search for the starting-point of knowledge, and in <i>Euthyphro </i>and other early dialogues Socrates&#x2019; inquiries begin with a truth claim and work backward to find the basis upon which this claim rests. Only if such a basis could be discovered would the claim to &#x201c;know&#x201d; what was originally asserted be considered valid. This exemplifies a quest for the ground upon which certain knowledge stands and the starting-point from which all genuine knowledge must descend. <i>Euthyphro</i> exhibits another common characteristic of Socrates&#x2019; inquiries as portrayed in the early dialogues: It ends at an impasse. No adequate basis for knowledge of any of the proposed answers to the question, &#x201c;What is piety?&#x201d; is discovered. The typical outcome of the early &#x201c;What is X?&#x201d; inquiries is negative.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>This last point is a key to understanding Socrates&#x2019; famous claim in <i>Apology</i> that he is the wisest of men because <i>he knows that he does not know</i>. However, as Socrates explains to the court in <i>Apology</i>, he could not stop at establishing the extent of his own ignorance. Rather, he believed himself divinely called upon to demonstrate to all others who thought they possessed knowledge of moral virtues that they were actually as ignorant as he. This activity he defends as essential to the well-being of the state on the basis that those who act in the belief that they possess knowledge that in actuality they lack are likely to steer the ship of state aground. The larger implication is that Socrates believes this is not only what has occurred in recent Athenian history, it is the natural trajectory of human governments. In this context Socrates&#x2019; invocation at trial of the inscription &#x201c;know yourself&#x201d; on the Oracle at Delphi is a politically charged remark and a disguised accusation that those orchestrating his trial and execution are doing so because they benefit from the majority&#x2019;s ignorance of which kinds of actions are genuinely right or wrong. One last quotation from <i>Apology</i> belongs in this context. &#x201c;The unexamined life is not worth living,&#x201d; according to Socrates, at least in part because ignorance invites forms of political manipulation and exploitation that cannot be deployed successfully against populations in which every citizen &#x201c;knows himself.&#x201d;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>In <i>Crito</i>, the method of inquiry is not of paramount importance. What is central is the fact that Socrates, having agreed to live according to Athenian laws with full knowledge of their flaws and their susceptibility to abuse, accepts his obligation to obey them even when they have been used unjustly and in a way that is going to cost him his life. Thus he satisfies his conscience and sets a definitive example of moral consistency by courageously refusing Crito&#x2019;s offer to arrange his flight from prison and a comfortable life in exile.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The politically motivated conviction and execution of Socrates obviously had a profound effect on Plato, and <i>Phaedo</i>, while on the surface marks the conclusion of the story of the trial and death of Socrates, on a deeper level signals an important step in Plato&#x2019;s efforts to provide a philosophical defense of Socrates&#x2019; actions and a metaphysical explanation for why goodness and justice do not necessarily prevail.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>In <i>Phaedo</i>, Socrates&#x2019; inquiries do not end negatively. This dialogue&#x2019;s Socrates is not ignorant of that which he is seeking. He possesses knowledge. This is a crucial point because it indicates that Plato believes Socrates&#x2019; inquiries did not have as their intended goal the revelation that nobody knows what he or she is talking about when it comes to matters of morality but, rather, that Socrates was seeking knowledge of something that no one had yet conceived. We noted that Socrates&#x2019; questions in <i>Euthyphro</i> point to his criteria for an adequate answer to questions of the form: &#x201c;What is X?&#x201d; In <i>Phaedo</i> Socrates expounds the theory of &#x201c;Ideas&#x201d; &#x2013; Plato&#x2019;s technical term for disembodied intelligible entities, the discovery of which, Plato implies, was the true objective of Socrates&#x2019; inquiries, and knowledge of which provides the sound basis on which knowledge of everything else must rest. The Ideas are said to be unchanging, everlasting and immortal, independent of the unstable world of particular things which we experience, constant, invisible, and pure. Human souls, it is argued, possess the same characteristics and before becoming trapped in bodies, they dwell in communion with the Ideas. But the material world corrupts our minds, flooding our sense organs with ever-fluctuating data, and so, when a soul is attached to a body, it has but a dim recollection of the Ideas. Mankind&#x2019;s confused recollection of the Ideas of justice, courage, and piety is what causes reprehensible human behavior. And in this light Socrates&#x2019; inquiries can be understood to have been attempts at cultivating among fellow citizens a purer recollection of the original &#x201c;patterns&#x201d; or &#x201c;forms&#x201d; of virtuous actions so that they may know, understand, and act in accordance with them. The failure of Socrates&#x2019; enemies to know the Ideas of virtue that he taught can thus be seen as the cause of their ignorance of the goodness of his actions and, in turn, as the cause of their own wicked actions against him.

A boisterous Weimaraner with super smarts and an incredible sniffer, Lily is trained to be a search and rescue dog. One day Lily becomes very sick. She survives a mysterious illness with the help of veterinarians and her owner/best friend Tara by her side. Lily&#39;s recovery is a miracle, but her challenges are far from over. A mere month later, Joplin is hit by a massive tornado that runs smack through the center of the city. The tornado leaves a changed town in its wake. Lily&#39;s bravery and resilience are put to the test, as she is called upon to help put her city back together, piece by piece. Join Lily as she lives right, trains hard and fights the good fight. This is a true story of hope and hometown heroes, celebrating the courageous spirit of a city and very special dog.

She currently lives in St. Louis, Missouri, where she works as a zookeeper. Illustrator Nick Hayes is also a storyboard artist and graphic designer. He lives in London.On May 22, 2011, a mile-wide, 200-miles-per-hour tornado struck Joplin, Missouri, and this engaging picture book looks at the event from the perspective of Lily, a lovable Weimaraner trained by her owner, Tara Prosser, to be a search-and-rescue dog. Mueller supplies a bit of background on the duo--Lily was often called to duty in missing-persons cases--before depicting the effects of the tornado. Though 158 people died in the disaster, Mueller keeps the fear limited to a two-page spread of people fleeing the tornado as it comes up a downtown street. Afterward, the town is rubble, and while Lily helps sniff out survivors, Tara looks across the town and sees &#39;&#39;helpers . . . everyday heroes . . . lots of friends.&#39;&#39; The book&#39;s focus waffles a bit between Lily and Tara, but it&#39;s helped greatly by Hayes fantastic, colorful illustrations, which depict the disorder with a Chris Ware-style neatness of form. A unique, appealing take on an unusual topic. --Booklist; June 1, 2014</p><h2>Bessie Smith and the Night Riders</h2><p>Even though she can&#x2019;t afford a ticket to see the great blues singer Bessie Smith perform, Emmarene listens outside Bessie&#x2019;s tent&#x2014;that is, until she bursts into the show to warn the crowd:The Night Riders have come!<p>Bessie marches right outside and confronts the Night Riders by giving one of her famous low moans that says, "I may be down and out, but I ain&#x2019;t gonna take it no more."

She lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan.<p> A renowned fine artist, John Holyfield lives in Fairfax Station, Virginia.</p>Gr. 2-4. Like Pam Munz Ryan's <i>Amelia and Eleanor Go for a Ride</i> (1999), this is one of those books that seem to be history; then the author's note describes how (in this case) the incident was "dressed up for dramatic effect." Stauffacher bases her story on an event that took place in 1927. Bessie Smith, a blues singer, was performing in North Carolina when several Ku Klux Klan members tried to collapse the tent where she was performing. Bessie learned what was happening, confronted the men, and told them off, finishing up with, "You ain't nothin' but a bunch of sissies!" The story unfolds through the eyes of young Emmarene, a Smith fan, who can't afford a ticket to the show. Emmarene spots the Klansmen--or Night Riders--who, in this version, are on horseback, with torches, ready to burn the tent. This embellishment allows for a striking illustration in which Smith stares down rows of hooded riders, cussing at them and scaring them off. Yes, this is catalogued as fiction, but had there actually been a dozen torch-wielding riders as portrayed in the picture (rather than six on their feet in the real incident), this event might have had a different ending. Moreover, should kids want to find additional information on Smith, they will probably get more than they bargained for--including the suggestive lyrics of her songs and descriptions of her wanton ways. On its own, however, this book is dramatic fare, and kids will enjoy the story of a strong woman scaring off bad guys. Holyfield's thickly painted pictures are full of snap and sizzle, with gamine Emmarene making a good counterpoint to sassy, high-stepping Smith. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Once an architectural student at the Rhode Island School of Design, Macaulay glories in the intricacies and beauty of structure, as evidenced in his masterful pen-and-ink drawings in critically acclaimed children's books such as <i>Castle</i>, <i>Pyramid</i>, and <i>Rome Antics</i>. He begins <i>Cathedral</i> in 1252, when the people of a fictitious French town named Chutreaux decide to build a cathedral after their existing church is struck by lightning. We first meet the craftspeople, then examine the tools, study their cathedral plans, and watch the laying of the foundation. Week by week we witness the construction of this glorious temple to God. Macaulay intuitively hones in on the details about which we are the most curious: How were those enormously high ceilings built and decorated? How were those 60-foot-high windows made and installed in the 13th century? And how did people haul those huge, heavy bells up into the skyscraper-high towers? Thanks to Macaulay's thorough, thoughtful tribute to the Gothic cathedral, not a stone, turret, or pane of stained glass is left unexamined or unexplained.

He lives in Toronto.<br>There&#x2019;s no shortage of how-to-create-comics manuals around, but McLachlan (The Princess Planet webcomic) manages to distinguish his by breaking down complex concepts with very accurately age-targeted language and examples. His instructions are divided into 10 secrets, each an overarching and abstract idea essential to comics and story creation, like unifying words and art, practicing simplicity, creating ideas, and even a chapter on knowing when to break the rules. He then explains the concept in practical terms with easily understandable language and a great deal of enthusiasm. He fills each chapter with visual examples and pro tips and ends each one with exercises that will pull budding cartoonists right in. Though he affords ample time to the visual mechanics, McLachlan offers salient writing advice as well, touching on elements that have produced great stories for as long as there have been stories, in an easygoing and unintimidating manner. Indeed, like a beloved teacher, McLachlan&#x2019;s warmth, humor, and charm make this book the absolute best of its kind for the age group.

Wherever I go I tell the world about my wonderful mother. I'm a singer today because of her encouragement. She has been the biggest influence in my life."&#x2014;Daniel O'Donnell<br></i><br>Irish singing star Daniel O&#x2019;Donnell&#x2019;s mother, Julia, grew up on a remote island off the northwest coast of Ireland, going barefoot and doing hard labor as a child during the poverty-stricken 1920s. The hard work continued through her teenage years as she picked potatoes in the fields and traveled to Scotland to gut fish in the ports. After she married and settled in Kincasslagh, Julia's beloved husband, Francie, was forced to leave his family for months on end to work on farms, again in Scotland. The work was physically demanding and eventually took its toll. Sadly, Julia found herself widowed and penniless with five children while still in her forties. In this classic and inspiring story of triumph over adversity, Julia tells how she battled through this dark period by knitting sweaters into the early hours of every night to support her family. They were sold in America by relatives and the money was sent back to Ireland. Then, in an amazing twist of fate, this hard-working woman and dedicated mother watched from the wings as her offspring flourished in life. Her daughter Margo and son Daniel went on to achieve fame as chart-topping singers. In <i>The Mother's Story</i>, Julia takes us on a journey from her humble beginnings growing up in a thatched cottage on Owey Island, to a glitzy lifestyle mingling with celebrities and royalty. Poignant, warm, and laced with great humor, Julia&#x2019;s story gives us a fascinating insight into this remarkable Irish family&#x2019;s life.</p><p>Now in her eighties, Julia O&#39;Donnell continues to live in Kincasslagh, County Donegal, surrounded by her friends and family.</p><h2>Race war in high school;: The ten-year destruction of Franklin K.

She is a former lawyer turned writer and the mother of one son. She and her husband live in the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii.</b></p> <p><b>Kristin Hannah:</b> Well, first, I have to say, Emily, that I am just the tiniest bit irritated with you. When I got the call to do this interview, I was thrilled, to say the least. It came at a really busy time for me--right after the holidays and we all know how crazy that is--and my work in progress was giving me fits. Then I picked up <i>Heart of the Matter</i>, and lost myself. No more writing, no more cooking, no getting my hair done or reading my email. Once I started the story I literally couldn't put it down. Brava, girlfriend, I say. Your characters are so real and compelling, and they always say exactly the right thing. With so much honest emotion, I just have to ask how much of your work comes from your own life? </p> <p><b>Emily Giffin:</b> It never fails to thrill me when someone responds to one of my novels--especially when it's another writer. Writers understand the alchemy involved in making up something from nothing. And I just finished your book, <i>Night Road</i>, and I found it so emotional, so moving, and so terrifying--especially since I have three young children who will someday be teenagers. In terms of how much does my work come from my own life, I would say that I'm absolutely inspired by people, places, conversations, relationships, and issues that I observe, and that the "what if" part of my novel is very much inspired by these things in my life. But the details of my plots and the specifics of my characters come from my own head. How about you, Kristin? I'll ask you the million-dollar question that every author gets asked: where do you get your ideas? </p> <p><b>Kristin:</b> Ah, the idea question. I don't want to sound coy, but the truth is, I don't quite know. It's the most magical part of the process for me. I'm a pretty analytical gal, and I approach writing in the same just-the-facts-ma'am way I approach most things. I need to find an issue that engages me on an intellectual level, and then I need to marry that curiosity with a kind of passion. I need to feel genuinely passionate about each story before I ever write a word, and I have to actually have something to say. It takes me at least a year to research and write a novel, and so I have to really adore each part of it--the characters, setting, story. Most of all, it has to make me feel something genuine. That's really the most important component. Usually it begins with a single "what if" question--what if you discovered your mother had a whole secret life about which you knew nothing (<i>Winter Garden</i>) or what if your husband were accused of a crime you believed he hadn't committed (<i>True Colors</i>)--and then I write and re-write until the characters seem as real to me as old friends.</p> <p><b>Kristin:</b> I'm amazed by how much we have in common. We're both moms, both lawyers, both lived in London for a time. You're like a younger, cooler version of me. How did you make the transition from lawyer to writer, and do you think you'll ever practice law again? </p> <p><b>Emily:</b> I would hardly say I'm cooler than you, Kristin! I hear you live in Hawaii part time! What is cooler than that? I made the transition from lawyer to writer because I was so miserable being a lawyer that I needed some escape from the day-to-day of it. And inventing stories was that escape. I can say, without hesitation, that I will never practice law again. Would you? What kind of law did you practice, and for how long? What did you find appealing (or discouraging) about law? Did you find that it gave you fodder for any of your novels? </p> <p><b>Kristin:</b> Honestly, I have met very few lawyers who don't say that what they really want to do is write. Like you, I can say with certainty that I will never practice law again. Not that anyone would want me to. But I still keep my Bar membership up...just in case this whole writing thing doesn't work out. And yes, in the past few years, I have finally begun to put some of that law school education to work for me. I find that I'm really enjoying adding legal issues to my work. Of course, I have to talk to <i>real</i> lawyers to make sure I'm getting it right... </p> Read more of the conversation between Emily Giffin and Kristin Hannah <br><br><b>Kristin Hannah</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of novels including <i>Firefly Lane</i>, <i>True Colors</i> and <i>Winter Garden</i>.

In 1937, a German national living in Queens stole the blueprints for the country&#x2019;s most precious secret, the Norden Bombsight, delivering them to the German military two years before World War II started in Europe and four years before the US joined the fight. When the FBI uncovered a ring of Nazi spies in the city, President Franklin Roosevelt formally declared J. Edgar Hoover as America&#x2019;s spymaster with responsibility for overseeing all investigations. As war began in Europe in 1939, a naturalized German-American was recruited by the Nazis to set up a radio transmitter and collect messages from spies active in the city to send back to Nazi spymasters in Hamburg. This German-American, William G. Sebold, approached the FBI and became the first double agent in the Bureau&#x2019;s history, the center of a sixteen-month investigation that led to the arrest of a colorful cast of thirty-three enemy agents, among them a South African adventurer with an exotic accent and a monocle and a Jewish femme fatale, Lilly Stein, who escaped Nazi Vienna by offering to seduce US military men into whispering secrets into her ear.<br> <br>A riveting, meticulously researched, and fast-moving story, <i>Double Agent</i> details the largest and most important espionage bust in American history.<b> </b></p><p>Peter Duffy is the author of <i>Double Agent</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Bielski Brothers</i>,<i> </i>and <i>The Killing of Major Denis Mahon</i>.

But the loudest cheers came when Hitler made clear that the purpose of his speech was to declare war on the United States, his voice suddenly drowned out by raucous applause that escalated into a standing ovation.<br> <br>Late in the evening on the following day, Brooklyn time, a jury of nine men and three women filed into a packed courtroom in the old federal building on Washington Street. At a few minutes before midnight, the jury&#x2019;s foreman, Edward A. Logan, stood before the hushed assemblage and read guilty verdicts against the fourteen out of thirty-three Nazi spies who hadn&#x2019;t already confessed to their membership in what was known as the Duquesne Spy Ring, still to this day the largest espionage case in American history. The proceeding was unmarred by any disruption. &#x201c;The defendants took the verdicts stoically, for the most part,&#x201d; wrote the Times. Judge Mortimer W.

Sebold. In a culture that has come to celebrate even the most tangential representation of the Greatest Generation, his identity has remained mysterious, his picture never published. By 1951, Sebold had &#x201c;lapsed into an obscurity which has been protected ever since by the FBI,&#x201d; according to a magazine that used a pseudonym to describe him. &#x201c;All we know is that somewhere in the U.S. today is a tall, gaunt, middle-aged man to whom each native-born American can well doff his hat in love and respect,&#x201d; neglecting to mention that the non-native-born citizen owed him a debt of gratitude, too. When Sebold died in February 1970, no obituary or death notice appeared in the newspapers. A pivotal figure in America&#x2019;s confrontation with Nazism had been forgotten.<br> <br>&#x25aa;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25aa;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25aa;<br> <br>In the years before the formal commencement of hostilities, Hitler&#x2019;s agents were active in New York. They were a collection of ideologues, opportunists, dupes, adventurers, thugs, sophisticates, poseurs, patriots, seductresses, lackeys, and sympathizers. Most (but not all) were German immigrants who would come to be associated in the public mind (not always unfairly) with a single neighborhood of upper Manhattan, the home base of a nationwide movement of uniform-wearing Nazis whose rallies and marches were a constant source of media fascination. Dwelling within this community of the like-minded were a handful of individuals with the genuine talent to provide meaningful assistance to the German war machine. Few today realize that a Bavarian-born immigrant living in Queens, Hermann W. Lang, succeeded in stealing the plans for America&#x2019;s greatest prewar secret, a precious instrument of mythic reputation designed to turn modern airplanes into bomb-dropping systems of unprecedented accuracy, a brazen act of thievery that represents the most significant intelligence coup of the Third Reich.<br> <br>The spies of the thirties were initially able to conduct their work without worry of detection because the US government, focused on remedying economic misery in a period of rigid isolationism, hadn&#x2019;t assigned any agency to root them out. The story among the Soviet agents was that you could walk down Broadway wearing a sign identifying yourself as a spy and still not get caught. It took a botched investigation into a portion of the Nazi network in New York by an unprepared FBI to convince President Roosevelt that J. Edgar Hoover should be empowered to become the nation&#x2019;s first modern spymaster. Already a national celebrity for directing his &#x201c;G-men&#x201d; in a tommy-gun-assisted crusade against the John Dillingers and Pretty Boy Floyds of the early Depression, Hoover was given the authority to launch covert investigations against &#x201c;those who reflect in their pernicious activities the desires of enemy modes of thought and action,&#x201d; as he said in a speech on October 24, 1939, less than two months after Nazi Germany&#x2019;s invasion of Poland marked the beginning of the war in Europe.<br> <br>But Hoover&#x2019;s FBI couldn&#x2019;t rectify the failure to capture the most destructive Nazi agents in New York&#x2014;and prove that it had the ability to construct a counterespionage operation of sufficient expertise&#x2014;without Bill Sebold, a naturalized American of German birth who was both guileless and headstrong. In early 1939, he made the mistake of leaving Manhattan and returning to his mother&#x2019;s home in the Reich just as Hitler was stepping up his march to war. Through &#x201c;a strange set of circumstances,&#x201d; as a US diplomat put it, Sebold was coerced into the German espionage service and sent to the United States, accepting the assignment &#x201c;knowing that he would never go through with it, but knowing that he had to do something in order to get out of Germany alive,&#x201d; said the FBI. Upon his arrival in New York, he agreed to become the first double agent in Bureau history, the central figure in a pioneering undercover operation that steadily grew in size and sophistication, its expansion enabled by the Germans&#x2019; willingness to allow him to reach into an ever-widening circle of Hitler&#x2019;s underground.<br> <br>Under the guidance of the bespectacled special agent assigned to be his handler, Sebold proved to be a gifted improviser and tireless worker possessed of the fortitude to overcome his anxieties and face down some of the most ominous characters in the city. Since neutrality laws and political opposition prevented the Roosevelt administration from providing even limited military assistance to the Allied cause in Western Europe, the case represented our most consequential fight against Fascist aggression during the pivotal years of 1940 and 1941. The double agent, the skilled FBI men brought in from across the country to work with him, and even Hoover himself were among those honored few Americans who actually did something to stop Hitler at a time when national figures such as Charles Lindbergh were arguing for rapprochement. The thirty-three convictions ensured that the enemy could not call upon a small army of embedded loyalists once America joined the war and mobilized its full strength against the Axis. In February 1945, when the death of Nazi Germany was all but guaranteed, the New York Times said the &#x201c;elimination of this organization, which had extensive ramifications, placed a decisive check on German espionage operations, from which it has found it difficult to recover.&#x201d; The Manhattan Project to create our greatest wartime secret, the atomic bomb, would be infiltrated by Soviet spies not Nazi ones.<br> <br>Sebold became a particularly American kind of hero. He was an immigrant with a less-than-perfect grasp of English who stood in opposition to malignant beliefs from back home that were infecting his ethnic community. He was a brave man forced to endure the charge that he was a traitor to his own people because he regarded his oath of allegiance to the United States, taken when he became a citizen in 1936, as &#x201c;a sacred thing,&#x201d; in his description. When one of the accused spies called him a &#x201c;son of a bitch&#x201d; in a voice loud enough to be heard throughout the Brooklyn courtroom, an assistant prosecutor approached the bench and confided to the judge, &#x201c;This Sebold is the kind of a man that throws that kind of thing off like a duck throws water off.&#x201d; Judge Byers agreed. &#x201c;Of course he has shown that he has taken his courage right in his hands in this whole thing,&#x201d; he said out of the hearing of the jury, press, and spectators. &#x201c;Probably it is nothing new to him to hear people say those things, speak of him that way, but of course it is very distressing from the standpoint of decorum that that should be observed in the courtroom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As you know,&#x201d; FBI assistant director D. M. Ladd told Hoover in a memo on December 17, 1945, &#x201c;Sebold gave us the most outstanding case in the Bureau&#x2019;s history.&#x201d;</p><h2>Twilight: The Complete Illustrated Movie Companion</h2><p>Everything fans want to know about the hotly anticipated <em>Twilight </em>movie and much more!<br> Designed as a celebration of the film, this lavishly illustrated paperback edition is an exclusive behind-the-scenes guide featuring full-color photos of the cast, locations, and sets, as well as storyboards, interviews, details of the special effects, and much more.</p><p>Mark Cotta Vaz is the author of over twenty-one books, including four <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers.

Narrated in a laconic New Englander's style by his sister, this episodic look at the gigantic baby's first year of life is milked for every ounce of its illustrative worth. Diaper changing requires hazmat suits, fire hoses, and talcum powder dispensed via helicopter; knitting hats and booties for the nipper sends a kindly lady with bandaged hands into catatonia; real boats become the toys in each ocean bath, and eating ice cream means swallowing the truck as well as its wares. Each lush spread in Hawkes's characteristic style uses space and perspective to particular advantage as it focuses on the wicked big toddlah. The many bits of visual humor will keep youngsters poring back and forth over the pages.

Reprint.</p><p>Orientalist Lattimore and his wife spent the six early months of their married life apart. They had planned a honeymoon in Chinese Turkestan, but they would reach it by different routes: Owen by caravans across Mongolia (a trip outlined in The Desert Road to Turkestan); Eleanor by the Trans-Siberian Railway, followed by a lengthy, unanticipated midwinter sledge ride from Semipalatinsk to Chuguchak. But it is the trip through present-day Xinjiang (Sinkiang), then bordered by Mongolia, India, Tibet and the U.S.S.R., that primarily concerns these two parallel travelogues. What makes Xinjiang so fascinating is that it is the ultimate frontier. Replete with desert expanses and nearly untraversable mountain passes, in 1927 it was home to petty lordlings, shysters, renegades and mercenaries of every background (including many White Russians). Eleanor's impressionistic epistolary account is by far the more readable of the two. Owen, one of the "Old China Hands" who would be excoriated by McCarthy, offers a scholarly account that bears the passage of 70 years less easily. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hidden Passions : Secrets from the Diaries of Tabitha Lenox</h2><p><p> Welcome to Harmony... </p><p> A dreamy New England Coastal town, filled with cobblestone streets, charming colonial homes ... and tumultuous secrets that threaten to tear its families apart.

She is the recipient of grants from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. She was awarded the 1999 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize for Bathwater Wine and was a bronze-medal finalist for the 2001 National Book Award for Poetry for Mercurochrome.Coleman ( Heavy Daughter Blues, etc.) pens knowing tales of the black urban poor, describing hardworking waitresses looking for a way out, a man who literally starves himself to death supporting a luxury car, and a future world where the lower classes must pay the government or be executed. Her best pieces, such as "Dream 5281," about a group of women accosted by toughs, and "The Big Little Gang," concerning underage criminals, are distinguished by smooth plotting, effective suspense and deft characterization. The title story, a psychological fantasy, is both striking and elegant, while the delightful "Take It Up at the Bridge" succeeds as a jazz riff in words. All too often, however, the narration waxes amateurish and stilted, the action is jarring and the principals fail to ring true. An egregious example is "Reba," in which the heroine's odd behavior is explained by the revelation that she has eaten her baby. A more restrained editorial focus would have resulted in a slimmer volume and a better showcase for Coleman's talents. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Isaiah 40-66-OTL (Old Testament Library)</h2><p>This critically acclaimed series provides fresh and authoritative treatments of important aspects of Old Testament study through commentaries and general surveys.

He is the author of <i>Paradise</i> and <i>Admiring Silence</i>, both published by The New Press.Dense, accomplished and sharply conceived, this novel by Anglo-African writer Gurnah (Paradise; Admiring Silence) tells the story of 65-year-old Saleh Omar, a merchant refugee from Zanzibar who applies for asylum in England. A present-day Sinbad, Omar is fleeing a land where the evil jinn are the larcenous rulers equipped with all the accoutrements of contemporary authoritarianism concentration camps, rifles, kangaroo courts, etc. Upon arrival at Gatwick Airport, Omar presents an invalid visa, made out to his distant cousin and most hated enemy, Rajab Shaaban Mahmud. Advised not to demonstrate that he knows English, he puts on a charade of incomprehension for his caseworker, Rachel Howard, until uncomfortable circumstances force him to speak. In the meantime, Rachel contacts the English expert on Kiswahili, Latif Mahmud, who just happens to be the real Rajab Shaaban's son. Inevitably, the two men get together in a little seaside English town. Latif long ago cut off all relations with his Zanzibar family, having taken refuge in England in the '60s and gone on to become an English professor and poet, and a rather lonely single man. Saleh, he learns, has been pursued vindictively by Rajab and his wife, Asha, the mistress of a powerful minister. Due to recriminations over an inherited property, Saleh was eventually dispossessed of his house, arrested and imprisoned in various camps. Getting out, he starts over, only to be threatened by Latif's brother, Hassan. Gurnah's novel is a painful, unapologetically literate probe into the tragedy of the postcolonial world, where refugees are always emerging, "stunned, into the light of yet another gathering shambles." (June) Forecast: Paradise was short-listed for the Booker Prize, which should draw some critical attention to Gurnah's latest, though sales will likely be strongest at university bookstores. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fighting God: An Atheist Manifesto for a Religious World</h2><p><p><i>Fighting God</i> is a firebrand manifesto from one of the most recognizable faces of atheism. In his book, Silverman-a walking, talking atheist billboard known for his appearances on Fox News-discusses the effectiveness, ethics and impact of the in-your-face-atheist who refuses to be silent.</p><p>Silverman argues that religion is more than just wrong: it is malevolent and does not deserve our respect. It is our duty to be outspoken and do what we can to bring religion down. Examining the mentality, methods and issues facing the firebrand atheist, Silverman presents an overwhelming argument for firebrand atheism and reveals:</p><p><i>- All</i> religion is cafeteria religion and almost all agnostics are atheists.<br>- American society grants religion a privileged status, despite the intentions of the Founding Fathers.<br>- Christian politicians have adversely (and un-Constitutionally) affected our society with regard to science, health, women's rights, and gay rights.<br>- The notion of "atheist Jews" is a lie forced on us by religion.<br>- It is not "Islamophobia" to observe dangerous teachings and disproportionate violence in Islam.<br>- Atheists are slowly but surely winning the battle.</p><p><i>Fighting God </i>is a provocative, unapologetic book that takes religion to task and will give inspiration to non-believers and serve as the ultimate answer to apologists.</p></p><p>DAVID SILVERMAN is the president of American Atheists and one of the best-known atheists in America.

He lives in New Jersey with his wife and child. <i>Fighting God </i>is his first book.<p>Silverman's methods are refreshingly honest. He uncompromisingly believes in equality for everyone and the end of religious privilege in America, and he is not afraid to fight, using words, to bring about that reality. &#x2013;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;David Silverman is the bad boy of atheism and we need people like him. There's a tiresome breed of so-called atheists called the "I'm-an-atheist-BUT-heads". They love to put the emphasis on the "but", and go out of their way to emphasize how deeply they respect all faith although, with mawkish regret, they can't actually share it. David Silverman is not of their number, and how refreshing it is to read a book that is not afraid to speak the truth, sans apology.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Richard Dawkins</i></p><p>"This is one of the more enjoyable atheist reads I've come across....

But other creatures live there too, myriad insects of every kind, many of them ones that Goulson has studied before in his career as a biologist. You will learn about how a deathwatch beetle finds its mate, about the importance of houseflies, why butterflies have spots on their wings, about dragonfly sex, bed-bugs and wasps. Goulson is brilliant, and very funny, at showing how scientists actually conduct experiments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is also a wake-up call, urging us to cherish and protect life on earth in all its forms. Goulson has that rare ability to persuade you to go out into your garden or local park and get down on your hands and knees and look. The undiscovered glory that is life in all its forms on planet Earth is there to be discovered. And if we learn to value what we have, perhaps we will find a way to keep it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A Sting in the Tale</i>, Dave Goulson's account of a lifetime studying bumblebees, was one of the most gratifying success stories of 2013.

Among her many popular books for children are <em>Mangaboom</em>, illustrated by Anita Lobel; <em>Here Comes Henny </em>(based on the wordplay of James Joyce), illustrated by Nancy Winslow Parker; <em>Halfway to Your House</em>, illustrated by Gabrielle Vincent; <em>Flap Your Wings and Try</em> and <em>All Asleep</em>, illustrated by Nancy Tafuri; and <em>Posy</em>, illustrated by Catherine Stock (a Christopher Award book).</p>Her grandpa is adamant--Marisol may not have a dog, even though there are numerous strays on their Puerto Rican hillside; dogs have ``fleas and ticks and who knows what.'' Marisol doesn't complain, but bit by ingenuous bit she negotiates. This particularly appealing pooch, she alleges, has no fleas, so he can be petted. Soon the dog has a name, while permission to give him scraps leads inevitably to the purchase of dog food. When ``Pancho'' goes missing, Grandpa's concern equals Marisol's; and in the end, when Grandpa makes one last decree--Pancho, now firmly established, is to be an outside dog, he says--readers will guess it will endure no longer than his others. The naturally cadenced story includes a few Spanish words, nicely defined in context and in a pronouncing glossary. Plecas's expressive, simply rendered illustrations are in the same amiable spirit as the text. Pancho's insinuation into this affectionate family of two is charming.

She was born and raised on the Atlantic coast of Florida and now&nbsp;lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.<br>www.debrafrasier.com</p>``An animal that needed sound'' comes down to consume it entirely: as a leaping fish descends, ``the water died''; the animal ``drained the rustle from the leaves'' and ``drank till winter...[and until] It was finally tall and still, and he stopped on the highest ridge...and from there he walked on silently and began to starve.'' The world lies silent beneath the moon until at last a cricket's chirping initiates the renewal of sound, together with the life of ``our precious world.'' Stafford's language is fresh and muscular, his imagery compelling, though at first reading the imaginative leap from winter's silence to the seasonal cycle of death and rebirth is startling. Frasier provides sophisticated collages of simple forms cut from specially made striated paper, their predominantly somber tones brightened with fall's red and spring's green; ``the animal'' looks like a black polar bear. Altogether, the whole is more striking and unusual than attractive, the product of genuine talent yet somewhat labored. A BOMC selection.

Her books include <em>My Fair Lazy</em>, <em>Pretty in Plaid</em>, and <em>Bitter is the New Black</em>. She replaced Dave Barry as writer for <em>Humor Hotel</em>, a nationally syndicated humor column. Read on to see Jen Lancaster's questions for Dave Barry, or turn the tables to see what he asked her. <br> <br> <strong>Jen:</strong> The Pulitzer Prize looks a lot like those gold-colored one-dollar Sacagawea coins. Do you still have yours or did you accidentally use it in a parking meter? <br> <br> <strong>Dave:</strong> I actually lost my Pulitzer Prize for several years. I put it in a safe place, then I forgot where that was. My wife eventually found it and put it an even safer place. But your question disturbs me, because it&#x2019;s NOT a coin: It looks more like a middle-school diploma. So now I&#x2019;m wondering: Is it really a Pulitzer Prize? Maybe I was the victim of an elaborate practical joke wherein Columbia University gave me a middle-school diploma and just TOLD me it was a Pulitzer. That would make sense, because (a) nobody ever really believes I won a Pulitzer, and (b) in university circles Columbia is known as a big prankster. <br> <br> <strong>Jen:</strong> Does it indeed take a village? <br> <br> <strong>Dave: </strong> I actually grew up in a village, specifically the village of Armonk, New York. Everybody in Armonk knew everybody else back then, which meant that if, as a high-school student, you (and here I am using &#x201c;you&#x201d; in the sense of &#x201c;I&#x201d;) experimented a tad (and here I am using &#x201c;a tad&#x201d; in the sense of &#x201c;way&#x201d;) too heavily with adult beverages one night in the fall of 1964 and passed out on a lawn that&#x2014;of all the lawns you could have picked in Armonk&#x2014;was the lawn belonging to Chief of Police Hergenhan, you would not be arrested; instead, Chief Hergenhan, upon discovering you drooling facedown into his crabgrass at 1:30 a.m., would call your dad to come get you, because he knew your dad, and he also knew that you would spend approximately the next two weeks retching, which was punishment enough. So I would say yes. <br> <br> <strong>Jen:</strong> If X = Agent Jack Bauer and Y = shooting someone in the thigh, how many perimeters need to be set up to bring Edgar back to life? <br> <br> <strong>Dave: </strong> It depends on how long it takes Chloe to get a visual on the satellite and upload the schematics. <br> <br> <strong>Jen:</strong> Children seem to be more delicate than when we were kids. Do you advocate encasing them in Lucite until their eighteenth birthday? <br> <br> <strong>Dave:</strong> These kids today don&#x2019;t know how easy they have it, with their iPhones and their iPads and their atmosphere consisting of 21 percent oxygen and 78 percent nitrogen and 1 percent various other gases. When I was a youngster we didn&#x2019;t have ANYTHING. We didn&#x2019;t even have HAIR. We sat around naked in the cold, sucking on rocks for nourishment. But you never heard us complain, and by God we licked the Great Depression and won World War II. No, wait, that was our parents&#x2019; generation. But we faced challenges of our own. Junior year abroad, for example. That was no picnic. So you don&#x2019;t even want to KNOW what I think. <br> <br> <strong>Jen:</strong> Shirts or skins? <br> <br> <strong>Dave:</strong> You always want to be on the skins team, because that way you&#x2019;re guarding a guy on the shirts team, which means if you touch him you&#x2019;re touching his shirt, which is an okay way to touch another guy (for very a brief period). If you&#x2019;re on the shirts team, you have to guard a guy on the skins team, which means you might come into contact with his actual skin, which is wrong on several levels, not the least of which is that he will be oozing perspiration slime, like a giant eel with b.o. This is the main reason why guys turn to golf. <br> <br> <strong>Jen:</strong> Will men use GPS or do they consider this the modern-day equivalent of stopping to ask for directions at the gas station&#x2014;which is to say, an affront to their masculinity? <br> <br> <strong>Dave:</strong> It&#x2019;s acceptable to use a GPS because it is an incomprehensibly complex electronic device and therefore manly. But it is NOT acceptable to use the same GPS for long periods of time. Every six months or so you must buy a newer model with more features that you don&#x2019;t need and a larger screen. Screen size is the important thing. Your goal is to eventually have a GPS with a screen so large that you can&#x2019;t see out your windshield; when you drive you&#x2019;re just looking at this humongous GPS screen. But you are still wondering, deep inside, when they&#x2019;re going to come out with a bigger one. <br> <br> <strong>Jen:</strong> Bret Michaels&#x2019;s fans still throw their panties onstage when he performs. What do Rock Bottom Remainders groupies toss? <br> <br> <strong>Dave:</strong>We have had panties thrown at us. But they were labeled &#x201c;MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY 30 PEOPLE.&#x201d; <br> <br> (Photo of Jen Lancaster � Jeremy Lawson) <br> (Photo of Dave Barry � Raul Ribiera/Miami Herald)Dave Barry is a humor columnist.

After working as a photographer's assistant in a Paris fashion studio, Nascimbene studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York and at the University of California at Davis. Nascimbene's illustrations have appeared in numerous publications worldwide, including <em>Time, Newsweek, The Wall </em><em>Street Journal,</em> <em>Chicago Tribune, </em>the <em>New Yorker, Boston Globe, Toronto Life, Scientific</em> <em>American, Atlantic Monthly, Hemispheres,</em> etc. His commercial clients include Air France, British Airways, Continental Airlines, IBM, Apple, Macy's, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Bank of America, United Way, Est�e Lauder, Manpower, and more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nascimbene also illustrated Houghton's&nbsp;<em>Hachiko </em>by Pamela Turner and <em>The Beautiful Christmas Tree </em>by Charlotte ZolotowKindergarten-Grade 3-When a city street undergoes gentrification, its elegant residents are disdainful of unfashionable Mr. Crockett, who moves in and cleans up the smallest, least-desirable brownstone on the block. They don't approve of him washing windows; they don't approve of him planting a spindly little pine tree; they certainly think he is crazy to sprinkle bread crumbs under the tree for birds to eat. The man, however, believes that "Beauty is as beauty does," and his loving attention culminates, years later, when carolers stop by his majestic tree, startling the birds up onto the branches like living ornaments. The carolers and birds sing together "a chorus of love, and Mr. Crockett [knows] that this is what Christmas [is] meant to be." Nascimbene's watercolors generally appear opposite text, or in small boxes above or below text. A cool palette of darker colors predominates. In the initial illustrations, cars and "elegant neighbors" appear to be circa 1940; as time progresses, the story takes place in modern times.

Linked together by a web of religious, commercial, and intellectual connections, the different regions of Asia&#39;s vast civilization, from Arabia to China, hummed with commerce, international diplomacy, and the brisk exchange of ideas. Stewart Gordon has fashioned a fascinating and unique look at Asia from A.D. 700 to 1500, a time when Asia was the world, by describing the personal journeys of Asia&#39;s many travelers-the merchants who traded spices along the Silk Road, the apothecaries who exchanged medicine and knowledge from China to the Middle East, and the philosophers and holy men who crossed continents to explore and exchange ideas, books, science, and culture.</p><p><b>Stewart Gordon</b> is Senior Research Scholar at the Center for South Asian Studies at the University of Michigan, and author of three books on Asia. He lives in Ann Arbor.Gordon, a Senior Research Scholar at the University of Michigan, recalls Thomas Cahill's "Hinges of History" series in this accessible history-in-portraits. Covering "the thousand years from 500 to 1500, when Asia was an astonishing, connected, and creative place," Gordon bases each chapter on the actual memoir of someone who lived, worked and traveled there. Each story has its own unique appeal, the most compelling of which is probably Abraham bin Yiju's: a Jewish spice trader living in southwestern India around 1140 CE, his life proves dramatic and transient, and his letters poignant, as in this plea for news of relatives caught up in the Crusades: "No letter... detailing who died and who remained alive, has arrived. By God, write exact details and send your letters with reliable people to soothe my mind." It's a rare joy-and a slight shock-to find such rich evidence of lives lived 1,000 years ago; given the way time erases personal history, however, it makes sense that each man's story feels incomplete. Gordon lacks the vision and distinctive voice of a Cahill, but history buffs will find this book more than worthwhile. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But even the most devout North Shore traveler doesn&#39;t know Lake Superior like Kathryn and William Mayo do. These explorers and residents of the region outline the best sites you may not know about. This entertaining guide will lead you to 61 hidden treasures and tourist favorites, so you&#39;ll experience the beautiful region in a whole new way.</p><p><p><b>William Mayo</b> is a former Duluth resident and has lived in Two Harbors, Minnesota, for the last 23 years. Long a part of the poetry scene of the North Shore and a former Artist-in-Residence for Isle Royale National Park, he has published work in <i>National Geographic Traveler</i>, <i>Poets Who Haven&#x2019;t Moved to St. Paul</i>, and <i>Zenith City Arts</i>. He also holds an AAS Degree in Human Services and is an enrolled member of the Leech Lake Pillager Band. His love of the North Shore came early, while driving along old Highway 61 with his parents as a boy. Whether in a canoe, diving, or walking the beach, he is always awe-inspired by the eternal mystery of the Lake.</p><p>A Minnesota native and longtime visitor to the North Shore, <b>Kathryn Mayo</b> now resides within view of Lake Superior. Frequent trips &#x201c;Up North&#x201d; finally gave over to permanent residence, and Kate has drawn on her previous perspective as a visitor to the area in the compilation of these narratives. She spent most of her career in the role of counselor and is a licensed therapist and addictions counselor with an MA in counseling psychology.</p><p><b>Gem 4: Stoney Point</b></p><b> </b><p><b>How to Get There:</b> On Old 61, travel about 8 miles from the Old Pump House at Lakewood. Turn right off of Old 61 onto Stoney Point Drive. This gravel road travels about 1 mile before rejoining Highway 61. There are numerous spots where there is enough room on the shoulder to park safely.</p> <p>From Highway 61 Expressway, head north of Duluth for about 10 miles. Turn right at Alseth Road and follow it for about 1 mile all the way to Stoney Point Drive.</p> <p><b>Accessibility:</b> This is a great place to view the lake, and because it&#x2019;s so accessible by car, anyone can pull off to the side of the road and get an eyeful without even getting out. The road also offers a nice place to take a stroll to stretch your legs, and it is relatively even and flat. Getting down to the water&#x2019;s edge requires some scrambling on rocks, so use caution.</p> <p><b>Cool Things to Know:</b> Well known by locals as a great place to head to when the weather is roaring out of the northeast, this is an ideal spot for watching the Lake in her wild moods. When waves are crashing in a good blow, the spray can sometimes fly up over the road, giving you a safe front-row seat to the Lake at her most tempestuous.</p> <p>The lay of the land, angle of the shore, and power of Lake Superior make this a favorite spot of surfers who say it rivals some of the best surfing locales in the world. A good day for surfing can happen even in mid-winter, and, if you are lucky, you&#x2019;ll see many brave souls riding the waves here in full wetsuits. In good weather, you can explore the expanse of black basalt lava flow that is marked by clear striations and gouges left behind by the glaciers about 12,000 years ago.</p></p><h2>The Difficult Child</h2><p>How to help--and cope with--the difficult child<br><br>Expanded and completely revised, the classic and definitive work on parenting hard-to-raise children with new sections on ADHD and the latest medications for childhood disorders.<br><br>Temperamentally difficult children can confuse and upset even experienced parents and teachers.

Over half of American households share their home with either a cat or a dog, and many contain both. This is a huge change from only a century ago, when the majority of domestic cats and dogs were working animals, keeping rodents at bay, guarding property, herding sheep. Nowadays, most are valued solely for the companionship they provide. As mankind becomes progressively more urban and detached from nature, we seem to be clinging to the animals that served us well in the past.<br><br>In <i>The Animals Among Us</i>, anthrozoologist John Bradshaw argues that pet-keeping is nothing less than an intrinsic part of human nature. An affinity for animals drove our evolution and now, without animals around us, we risk losing an essential part of ourselves.<br><br></p><p><br><b>John Bradshaw</b> is the foundation director of the Anthrozoology Institute at the University of Bristol, and author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers <i>Cat Sense</i> and <i>Dog Sense </i>and coauthor of <i>The Trainable Cat</i>. He lives in Southampton, England.<br>"If you're comfortable with your own animality, <i>The Animals Among Us</i> can be your bestiary and breviary. I found Bradshaw's arguments about the domestication of animals and the origins of pet-keeping perfectly convincing; and his conclusion--that we have now co-evolved long enough with dogs, and to some extent with cats, for it to constitute an effective symbiosis --rather comforting."&#x2015;<b>Will Self</b>, <b><i><b><i>Guardian</i> (UK), Book of the Day</b></i></b><br><br>"Bradshaw is a pioneer.... His answer...is richly, empathetically and affectionately respectful of the human-animal bond.... Readers may be less interested in themselves as pet owners, yet this is actually a bolder and more important book."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Sunday Times</i> (UK)</b></i></b><br><br>"Bradshaw knows how to produce a well-written and accessible tome.... In one of the best and most thought-provoking parts of his book, [he] dissects the practice of anthropomorphism as a typically human attempt to understand the animals with which we live so intimately. He raises important questions about the greater significance of keeping pets and their benefits."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New Scientist</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Bradshaw's...gentle warmth and intelligence make the book enjoyable. A sound introduction to a relatively new area of study, both for those who share their households with animals and those who never would."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A marvelous achievement, both scientifically accurate and delightfully accessible. If you like animals, have pets, or are simply curious how and why people and other species interact, you'll learn a lot from this book, and will have a great deal of fun doing so!"<br>&#x2015;<b>David P. Barash, professor of psychology emeritus, University of Washington</b><br><br>"In <i>The Animals Among Us</i>, John Bradshaw integrates findings from the fields of anthropology, history, animal behavior, and evolutionary psychology to answer a fundamental mystery -- why do we love pets? Beautifully written by a pioneer in the study of human-animal relationships, this book is an intellectual treat that challenges the way we look at the animals in our lives."<br>&#x2015;<b>Hal Herzog, author of</b>, <b><i><b><i>Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It's So Hard To Think Straight About Animals</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Animals Among Us</i> reminds us that despite the unprecedented assault by humankind on free-ranging nonhuman animals during the present epoch called the Anthropocene, most humans are inherently attracted to other animals, especially the companions with whom we share our homes and hearts. Best-selling author John Bradshaw rightly argues that when we lose other animals, we lose parts of ourselves. As innate 'biophiliacs,' the chemistry we share with household companions makes us human, and this attraction can help serve to bridge the empathy gap so that we will then extend kindness and compassion to other animals with whom we're less familiar."<br>&#x2015;<b>Marc Bekoff, author of</b>, <b><i><b><i>Canine Confidential: Why Dogs Do What They Do</i></b></i></b><br><br>"I read everything John Bradshaw writes. He is the professor you always wish you'd had: knowledgeable yet approachable, engaged and engaging. If you are in any way interested in the underpinnings of the human-animal relationship, this is the book for your bookshelf."<br>&#x2015;<b>Alexandra Horowitz, author of</b>, <b><i><b><i>Inside a dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know</i></b></i></b><br><br>"What good are pets? John Bradshaw's affectionate investigation puts your favorite ideas to the test of science. We might not get the health benefits that were once thought important, but there are plenty of other reasons to love Fido. <i>The Animals Among Us</i> is a fond testament to our companion animals and our extraordinary relationships with them."<br>&#x2015;<b>Richard Wrangham, author of</b>, <b><i><b><i>Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Backed up by impeccable research...[an] excellent book.... Bradshaw provides a convincing case that our fascination with the interior lives of animals was an essential part of our evolutionary development."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>The New Statesman</i> (UK)</b></i></b></p><h2>When a Heart Cries (Mountain Lake Minnesota Trilogy)</h2><p><p><b><i>Their beloved little home was full of love . . . but it still felt empty</i> </b></p><p></p>Samantha and Adam Klaassen started married life in the cozy little home built into the hill at the back of the Klaassen family farm. When they began looking forward to their own family, they knew they would need a real house with more room.<p></p><p>But now the silent bedrooms in the farmhouse built with such love and hopefulness by her husband haunt Samantha's days and nights. Why does God not see her yearnings for a child and answer the nearly constant prayers? And watching her sister-in-laws joyfully welcoming new little ones into their homes while her own arms lay empty nearly does her in. Does God even listen when a heart cries so fervently and long?</p></p><p>Bestselling, award-winning author <b>Kim Vogel Sawyer</b> wears many hats besides "writer."

Concentrated on the Los Angeles area, the program oversaw the design of 36 prototype homes, and sought to make available plans for modern residences that could be built easily and cheaply during the postwar building boom. This highly experimental program generated designs that would redefine the modern home, and its profound influence on architecture&#x2014;American and international&#x2014;was evident during the program&#x2019;s existence and remains so today. <strong>This compact guide includes all the projects featured in our XL edition, with over 150 photos and plans, and a map showing the locations of all the Case Study Houses, including those no longer existing. </strong> &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Architecture Series features:<ul> <li>an introduction to the life and work of the architect</li> <li>the major works in chronological order</li> <li>information about the clients, architectural preconditions as well as construction problems and resolutions</li> <li>a list of all the selected works and a map indicating the locations of the best and most famous buildings</li> <li>approximately 120 illustrations (photographs, sketches, drafts and plans)</li> </ul></p><p>Elizabeth A.
